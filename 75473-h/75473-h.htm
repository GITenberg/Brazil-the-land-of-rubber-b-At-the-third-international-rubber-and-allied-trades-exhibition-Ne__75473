</div>

<p>Brazil occupies no less than ten thousand square feet of space
on the Balcony Floor. The Exhibit is specially comprehensive.
There is a fine archway to each entrance to the court dominated
by the arms of the Federal Government. An Information
Bureau is provided, at which all enquiries as to Brazilian rubber
will be answered. The walls are hung with statistics and maps
of the country. Close by are the offices of the Brazilian Commissioners
and a refreshment kiosk, where the Federal Government
dispenses Brazilian coffee to visitors. One of the first
things to strike the eye is the huge recumbent figure of the
Rubber Colossus, overlooking the mighty Amazon and its innumerable
tributaries, all of them highways of the rubber collecting
industry. From this point the visitor may, with the
assistance of a number of pictures, 22 feet by 12 feet, take a
bird’s eye view tour up the Amazon. Alongside these pictures
is a unique collection from the different States of Brazil of rubber
and other products, the preponderance of the rubber industry
being illustrated by a fine pyramid of caoutchouc. Dotted here
and there are life-sized models of Brazilian workmen in their
native costumes. Arriving at the entrance to the Amazonas Section
we find Dr. Pinto actually engaged in the coagulation of
latex by his new smokeless process, which manufacturers have
admitted turns out excellent rubber and which has the great
advantage over the native system hitherto in vogue, of saving an
enormous amount of both time and labor, whilst giving splendid
results. A second series of pictures affords a vivid idea of the
salient features of the State of Amazonas. In this section we
have a mountain of rubber, and a ball which weighs 1,600
pounds. There is a fine picture of a native tapping a rubber
tree and numerous very beautiful photographs. That nothing
may be wanting to the completeness of the representation of
Brazil’s great rubber industry a series of Moving Pictures is
shown in the Main Hall of the Exhibition, which visitors will
find particularly instructive after they have gone through the
Brazilian Section on the Balcony Floor.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

</div>

<p>Brazil, with its vast and immeasurable virgin forests in the
valley of the Amazon, undoubtedly the greatest in the world,
traversed by innumerable tributaries, many of which are larger
and deeper than many of the rivers in other countries, can be
considered the largest storehouse of native rubber of the best
quality, all ready to be extracted, coagulated and applied to all
kinds of industries. No other investment of capital can be as
remunerative as that invested in the extraction of the native rubber
from full grown trees, already existing in large quantities of
many millions, and in zones full of natural richness.</p>

<p>For the culture of rubber trees of the various species, the
whole northern and central portions of Brazil are well adapted,
and will give magnificent results in the near future.</p>

<p>Nature has prodigally provided easy means of communication
by waterways broad and deep. The climate is equitable
without great variations of temperature, which gives perpetual
summer and produces large and nearly uninterrupted harvests of
agricultural products.</p>

<p>The difficulties which hinder the rapid development of the
extraction of rubber are the obstructions in rivers in certain
places, at certain seasons of the year when the water is low, and
the fact that the production of rubber is so remunerative that all
the vigorous men that are thus engaged do not care to engage
in any other industry. Thus it is that living in the rubber regions
is very expensive because everything must be brought there,
even implements and foodstuffs.</p>

<p>These difficulties, however, have been brought to the attention
of the Federal Government of Brazil, and of the States,
and in consequence an important Congress was called and presided
over by the Minister of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce.
The Legislative power also passed special laws providing
measures urgently needed to better the existing conditions.
These laws also provide for a department under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
Minister of Agriculture, Industry and Commerce, to be called
“The Protection of Rubber,” which has already been formed
and is at work.</p>

<p>Among the various and important provisions of the law, is
the establishment of various experimental stations for advancing
the cultivation of the four different kinds of rubber trees found
in Brazil, the Hevea braziliensis (seringa), castillôa (caucho),
maniçoba, and mangabeira. These trees are all natives of Brazil
and can be cultivated from the upper regions of the Amazon to
the States of S. Paulo and Paraná. That is, from the extreme
north to nearly the extreme south, one or other of these species
can be cultivated, according to the climate and character of the
soil in each region.</p>

<p>Various concessions and money premiums are offered to attract
capital and awaken activity in this industry. Certain services,
such as the establishment of hospitals, medical attention
and hygienic regulations are also provided by the Federal Government.</p>

<p>In the pages of this book will be found, fully treated, the
principal points of this important subject. From the statistical
tables published and from the exhibits displayed at the International
Rubber Exposition in New York, it can readily be seen
that the rubber of Brazil is judged the best in the world, and that
its production although already enormous is destined to be
largely increased.</p>

</div>

<p>It is in our diaries of the voyage of the Genovese Columbus,
that among the important occurrences of that notable crossing
of the ocean, which gave him immortality, appeared the first
references, made by Herrera, to the quality of a certain gum
utilized by the aborigines.</p>

<p>In 1536 Gonçalvo Fernandes d’Oviedo in his “Universal
History of the Indies,” published in Madrid, also mentioned the
uses which the indigenous tribes of North America made of
rubber skins in their amusements.</p>

<p>The Jesuit Charlevoix also refers to it and more fully yet
does John Torquemada who in his “Indian Monarchy,” expresses
himself thus: “There is a tree in this country (Mexico)
known to the natives as <b>ulequahuitl</b>, to whom it is of the greatest
value. This tree grows in the warm or torrid zone; and presents
itself of a medium height with rounded leaves of an ashy
color. It furnishes in abundance a species of glutinous white
liquid like milk, which makes it of great utility to them.</p>

<p>“The milk of the <b>ulequahuitl</b> is obtained by beating the tree
with a small hatchet. The liquid is then seen to ooze out from
the incision made like blood from a wound. The natives gather
it into dry hollow gourds of various sizes. It gradually takes
consistency in these receptacles, until it turns into a gummy
mass, from which it is easy to adapt it to any form which may
be required.</p>

<p>“Those who have no gourds, besmear their bodies with the
liquid substance, as it flows out from the tree; which in drying
forms itself into a species of membrane, which is easily taken
off and whose thickness varies according to the coating spread
over the skin. Skins very much appreciated for their elasticity
are made with this <b>ulli</b>. The ulli solidified serves for shields,
which thus are proof against the sharpest-pointed arrows, owing
without doubt to the pliability of the material, which does not
affect its tenacity.</p>

<p>“Kings and nobles habitually use shoes made of ulli. The
Spaniards of Mexico, moreover, impregnate their capes with
<b>ulli</b>, so as to make them water-proof, because it is proved that
such substance resists water in a marvelous manner, but melts
before the action of the sun.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span></p>

<p>In Mexico and Central America, the name of <b>Ule</b> still
denotes even to-day one of the rubber trees known as the
elastic Castille.</p>

<p>After the Spaniards, the French in 1736 occupied themselves
with that substance, whose interesting properties had not up
to that date come to deserve the attention of the Europeans.</p>

<p>De la Condamine sent by the French Government to Perú,
in order to measure a degree of the terrestrial meridian, was
the first to refer to the Hevea of the Guyana. In a note that
accompanied a small sample of resinous gum of a heavy dark
color, almost black, he said to the Academy of Sciences: “There
grows in the forests of the province of the Esmeraldas a tree
known to the natives by the name of Hevé; a white resinous
liquid something like milk runs out from it after making an
incision; this substance is collected in a leaf that is laid close
to the foot of the tree and afterwards is exposed to the sun,
when it gets black at first upon its surface and afterwards by
continuous exposure to the sun becomes black in all its mass.
Torches, which burn admirably well, are made from it. It is
known in Quito, that that tree grows also upon the banks of the
Amazon and that the Mainas call it cautchú. They make
earthen moulds in the form of bottles and cover them with that
material. Afterwards when the resin gets hard, they break the
mould and thereby obtain unbreakable water-jars much lighter
than glass bottles.”</p>

<p>Later on he wrote: “many are the uses which the Omaguas
make of that resin in the central parts of South America,
especially among the Indians of Pará where the Portuguese
gave to the tree that produces it, the name of <b>Pauseringa</b>, because
from it ‘seringas,’ much in vogue among the Omaguas,
are manufactured; these being little hollow balloons in the shape
of a pear, into which a tube is inserted.</p>

<p>“In Pará it is moulded in still many different manners, they
make <b>borracha</b>, faces of animals, hollow or solid balls and also
apply it in the manufacture of boots which become quite water-proof
and when smoked acquire the appearance of leather.”</p>

<p>Fresneau, a collaborator of de la Condamine, sought to
study the vegetable plants which produced that gum, obtaining
as a result that Aublet, a French botanist, proceeded to interest
himself in the question and completed de la Condamine’s
studies, and then classifying the hevé under the domination of
<b>Hevea Guyanensis</b>.</p>

<p>It was only in 1798 that the <b>Ficus elastica</b>, the first Asiatic
plant producer of rubber became known, and up till 1860 South
America, English India and Java were the only rubber-producing
countries in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>Much later than this—in 1885, Africa commenced to export
this article, an industry which reached its apogee after the
creation by Leopold II of the Independent State of the Congo.</p>

<p>In the meantime, in spite of the fact of some of the qualities
of rubber and even its applications being known in Europe
ever since the Sixteenth Century, it was only during the
Nineteenth Century, that this product conquered that position
as an article very much in evidence which it now occupies as an
indispensable material in modern industry or even still yet for
the necessities which civilization created.</p>

<p>Hérissant and Macquer, in 1768, discovered the first dissolving
processes; in 1770, Priestley vulgarized the property of the
“borracha” in wiping out lead-pencil tracings from which the
English name <b>Rubber</b> is derived; Berniard, Fourcroy, Berthollet,
Grossart and others occupied themselves about this commodity,
with more or less success. Madier, in 1820, found out a mechanical
means of cutting the rubber-blocks in order to obtain
elastic threads and three years afterwards, MacIntosh discovered
that naphtha dissolved rubber and thus made cloth impervious
to the action of water.</p>

<p>The adaption of rubber to industrial purposes such as the
manufacture of shoes, physical and surgical appliances, elastic
cloths, railway-buffers, machine-springs, etc., was fairly in full
swing when the discovery of the vulcanizing of rubber by
Goodyear sprung up, an occurrence which came to revolutionize
the incipient industry and enormously enlarge the scope of the
commercial application of that product, which thence forward
came to assume exceptional importance. The vulcanizing
method consists in the mixing of a certain quantity of rubber
with sulphur and in the exposure of that mixture to an elevated
temperature and to a high pressure during a certain space of time.
The rubber transforms itself considerably; the property of indefinite
hardness is lost, but presents greater resistency to the
forces of compression and lengthening-out, supports excessively
low temperature and becomes less sensible to the action of
ordinary dissolving ingredients.</p>

<p>In Brazil already existed up to 1840, a rudimentary industry
of shoe manufacturing and in the water-proofing of various
objects. The great demand for rubber caused by the development
of the industry in foreign countries and consequently
the very high profits that the extraction of rubber in the
Brazilian “seringaes” or native rubber-forests presented, destroyed
all that initiative and Brazil passed into the position
of a mere producer of the raw material. In order to appreciate
with what devotion the country lent itself to this occupation,
sufficient is it to contrast the 31 tons exported in 1827 with the
36,547 exported in 1911.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="RUBBER-PRODUCING_PLANTS">RUBBER-PRODUCING PLANTS—BOTANICAL DESCRIPTION—PRODUCTIVENESS—REGIONS
IN WHICH THEY EXIST</h3>

</div>

<p>At the present moment, more than 300 species of rubber-producing
plants are known to exist, these being distributed
among the tropical regions of the world. Trees of large size,
climbing plants and flexible creepers containing the precious
latex in their branches, trunk and roots, those vegetable growths
from the double point view of quantity and quality of rubber
produce have not an equal importance. The species worthy of
mention belong to four great families:</p>

<p>1.—Euphorbiacan, <b>Hevea</b>, <b>Micrandra</b>, <b>Manioh</b>. 2.—Ulmacean,
<b>Castillôa</b> and <b>Ficus</b>. 3.—Apocynacean, <b>Landolphia</b>, <b>Hancornia</b>,
<b>Kickxia</b>, <b>Carpodium</b> and <b>Clitandra</b>. 4.—Asclepiadaceas, <b>Callotropia</b>,
<b>Cynanchum</b>.</p>

<p>The production of rubber in America is principally furnished
by the heveas, micandra, manioh, castillôa and hancornia; that
of Asia by the ficus; and that of Africa by the landolphia,
clitandra and kickxia.</p>

<p>In the Amazonian region of Brazil, there exist about 21
species of heveas; of these the principal is the hevea braziliensis,
which under the name of “the Pará rubber-tree” deserves to be
classed in the front rank of all the other lactiferous plants in
the world. The <b>hevea braziliensis</b> furnishes the most highly
esteemed quality of rubber, and it is the value of that product
which determines the prices of all the other species of rubber
brought on to the market.</p>

<p>The heveas are powerful trees of from 20 to 30 metres high,
the trunk which is cylindric in form and of a light ashy color,
generally attains a diameter of from 0ᵐ80 to 1ᵐ20; the branches
only commence to grow at about 15 metres from the ground.
The leaves fall in June, but are speedily substituted by others;
it is during this period that the trees break into flower.</p>

<p>They grow in the valley of the Amazon, which within
Brazil embraces the State of the Amazonas, the federal territory
of Acre, almost all the State of Pará, the North of Matto
Grosso and of Goyaz and a part of the South of Maranhão, or say
about 5,000,000 of square kilometres.</p>

<p>Their <b>habitat</b> as a general rule is a low and warm region
whose temperature varies between 25° and 30°; without sudden
changes during the course of the year and they favor by preference
the watery soils, just swampy, damp and even marshy;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
however, at the head-waters of some rivers, they also live and
develop themselves perfectly well in dry and elevated land. In
the Amazonic forests, the average proportion is of one hevea-tree
for 80 trees of other species.</p>

<p>The milky latex circulates from the root to the leaves, existing,
however, in greater abundancy in the trunk, up to a height
of about 2 metres from the ground. The heveas in Brazil are
generally known by the term “seringueiras” and the forests in
which they are found are denominated “seringaes.”</p>

<p>The average production of a “seringueira” during the
harvest season, which extends over the space of 6 months, is
of 5 kilos of fine rubber and 750 grs. of sernamby.</p>

<p>The species most appreciated besides the <b>hevea braziliensis</b>,
are the <b>hevea de terra firme</b>, of which Dr. E. Ule treats in his
recent studies, and which are found on the frontiers of Matto
Grosso, the <b>hevea do Rio Negro</b>, called “seringa verdadeira”
(the real seringa), the <b>hevea benthamiana</b> and the <b>hevea dukei</b>,
<b>Hub</b>, from the region of the Japurá, all of them furnishing excellent
products.</p>

<p>In the valley of the Amazon exist the <b>micandras</b>, belonging
to the same family and producing a rubber of a superior quality,
since it is sold under the name of Fine-Pará. The production
of these trees goes to the market included in the category of
hevea, owing to its similarity to this latter. The <b>micandra
syshenoide</b> which is the most known species, is found on the
Lower Amazon, in the innumerable islands at the estuary of
the great Amazon River, in the valleys of the Madeira, the
Solimões, the Japurá and the Purús; the natives give it the
names of <b>tapurú</b>, <b>curupita</b>, <b>murupita</b> and <b>seringarana</b>. They
are leafy trees whose trunk is of from 0ᵐ80 to 1ᵐ in diametre and
from 20 to 25 metres high. They grow as well in the low lying
marshy soil as in the elevated lands, whence comes their denomination
of <b>tapurú da vargem</b> and <b>tapurú de terra firme</b>. The
tapurú is as lactescent or milky as the hevea and the latex
which it renders is equally rich, seeing that it gives 50 per cent
of fine rubber.</p>

<p>The trees whose product, the <b>caucho</b>, occupies the second
place in the general exportation of rubber from Brazil although
as a matter of fact it only commenced to come into the Brazilian
markets in the year 1896, belong to the family of the
Ulmaceas. These are the <b>Castillas</b> which up till a short time
ago have been classed as of the same species as that which
grows in Mexico and Central America—the Castilla elastica,
but studies made by professor O. Warburg show that they are
distinct species which was thence forward denominated
<b>Castilla Ulei, Warb.</b></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span></p>

<p>The “castillôa” is a tree of large proportions, reaching to
a height of from 12 to 18 metres; its trunk with a diametre of
from 0ᵐ60 to 0ᵐ90, is of an ashy gray color, smooth and sparingly
branched. The leaves are large, greater, indeed, on the
new plants than on the full grown trees and its fruit is of an
oily nature.</p>

<p>These trees grow in considerable quantities at the sources
or head-waters of the affluents of the Amazon on the latter’s
right bank, such as the Juruá, the Purús, the Madeira, the
Tapajóz and the Xingú, and on its left bank in the valleys of
the Japurá, the Iça, the Rio Negro and the Trombetas Rivers.
Abundant “cauchaes” or forests of cautchou trees exist also in
the region of the River Tocantins and of the Araguaya.</p>

<p>The “castillôa” is found therefore in the same regions as
those in which the “seringueiras” flourish; it exacts a warm
climate, a clayey or clayey-silicious soil, but does not thrive in
swampy ground or such as is easily inundated during the
rainy season.</p>

<p>The latex is found as much in the bark as in the alburno
and each tree felled produces on an average about 50 litres of
latex or say from 18 to 20 kilos of rubber.</p>

<p>“Ceará” is the mundial denomination of another quality of
Brazilian rubber, the rubber of the <b>Maniçoba</b> tree. The maniçoba
<b>manihot glaziovii</b> is a handsome tree 10 to 15 metres high,
and a native of the Northeastern region of Brazil. Its trunk
presents a diametre of from 20 to 50 centimetres and it possesses
few branches; its wood-fibres are weak and light. The cortex,
which possesses lactiferous vessels in abundance, is protected
by a silicose layer, easily removable. It is a plant of rapid
growth.</p>

<p>According to a classification made by Dr. Ule, there are
four species of manioh, the <b>m. glaziovii</b>, the <b>m. piauhyensis</b>, the
<b>m. dichotoma</b> and the <b>m. heptaphylla</b>, the which exist almost
throughout all Central Brazil, being specially abundant in
Ceará, Piauhy and Bahia.</p>

<p>Little exigent, it thrives in regions where the temperature
oscillates between 22° and 36°, on low-lying ground and it
develops itself well in lands of great altitude, in which the
thermometric average temperature is about 15°, resisting even
the hoar-frost.</p>

<p>It is indifferent to this tree whether the climate be damp or
dry, as long as the soil is dry.</p>

<p>The species most appreciated are those from Piauhy and
the Jequié (“sertão” or back-woods of Bahia). Those of Piauhy
present two varieties: the white and the black species, the white
being the most renowned. They are of small size, with abundant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
foliage and thick bark and darkish stem and give plenty of
the milky latex, the average being 1,200 grammes per tree.
Those of the Jequié, which grow between the rivers Paraguassú
to the north and of the Contas to the south, are a shrub-tree
whose trunk does not exceed 30 centimetres in diametre. The
bark is fine and of light clear color; it produces about 500
grammes of rubber.</p>

<p>The mangabeira (Hancornia speciosa) is a slender and
crooked shrub-tree, 3 to 4 metres high, and abounds on the
high-lying table-lands or plateaux in the interior of Brazil.
The trunk has a diameter of from 0ᵐ30 to 0ᵐ35; is scantily
leaved; the fruit is eatable and has a very agreeable taste.</p>

<p>A plant of an extraordinary resisting power, it defies the
inclemency of the climate, the absence of rains, the scarcity of
humidity and of nourishment from the soil. It predominates in
the <b>catingas</b> of the Northern States, in the <b>carrascaes</b> of Goyaz
and in the <b>cerrados</b> of S. Paulo, which means to say, that it is
found from Maranhão to S. Paulo, now in the Interior, as in the
mountain-range of the Mangabeiras between Maranhão and
Goyaz, in the central Chapada of Minas, in the Parecis of
Matto Grosso and in S. Paulo in the zone comprised between
the Paranápanema River and the Rio Grande, tributaries of the
Paraná River, and again on the littoral, which is the case from
Bahia northwards as far as Ceará.</p>

<p>There are several different varieties of this plant, there being
no indications, however, tending to point out any one of these
preferable to another with regard to the question of its yield.
The latex is of a bluish tint, its richness in rubber varying
greatly. Each mangabeira supplies on an average one kilogram
of rubber.</p>

<p>Besides the plants mentioned, there are still many others
in Brazil which furnish rubber, but which continue to grow
without being taken advantage of, on account of the little profit
they give.</p>

<p>To speak only of those which exploited on a small scale
have yet supplied the Brazilian markets with an appreciable
product, we may yet mention the <b>Massaranduba</b>, <b>Mimosups
elata</b>, and <b>Frei-Allem</b>, gigantic trees found from the Amazon and
Pará to Rio de Janeiro and Minas, abundant in the milky latex,
which being coagulated produces a rubber very similar to gutta-percha,
to which it serves as a substitute in all the latter’s most
important applications; and the <b>Sorva</b>, <b>Couma utilis</b>, <b>Muell. Arg.</b>,
which grow in Pará and in the Amazon valley, the latex of
which, the <b>leite de sorva</b>, enters, with a small coefficient into the
production of rubber in these two States.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="EXTRACTION_OF_RUBBER">EXTRACTION OF RUBBER, METHODS AND PROCESSES</h3>

</div>

<p>The great organic and biologic differences which exist between
rubber-trees, exact divers processes of preparation in
order to obtain a complete utilization of the productive capacity
of each.</p>

<p>It is, however, interesting before entering into a description
of the different processes adopted in Brazil, to here state what
the chemists think as to what rubber really is.</p>

<p>Rubber is a carburate of hydrogen which in the shape of
white globules more or less elongated, are found suspended in
the milky latex. The composition of those globules, although
even yet, badly defined, is represented by the formula (C¹⁰ H¹⁶)ⁿ.
Rubber is generally considered as a derivative of the Isoprina,
into which it transforms itself when submitted to the action of
dry heat, as Bouchardat demonstrated by his experiments in
1879. Treating the isoprina in a strong solution of chloridic
acid, an interesting body is obtained, which reminds one of
rubber on account of its elastic properties. Wallach, Tilden,
Weber, Harries and others gave themselves up to accurate
studies upon the composition of rubber; nevertheless, up till
to-day, however, no definite result has as yet been arrived at.</p>

<p>The latex, a thick liquid which has the appearance of animal
milk, circulates in special vessels, distributed diversely in the
organism of certain plants.</p>

<p>The following are the results of the analysis obtained from
the latex of the <b>hevea braziliensis</b> by Seelingmann, Scott and Bamber:</p>

<p>It is advisable to note, that the proportion of water may
vary a great deal, influenced sometimes by the season being
either wet or dry, and at other times by the weakness or vigor
of the tree at the occasion of its being tapped.</p>

<p>The quantities of proteine, resin and ash are dependent on
the chemical composition of the soil, those quantities affect the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
quality of the rubber, which is the more elastic, resistent and
durable the smaller the proportion of those elements.</p>

<p>In the coagulation of the latex, the resin incorporates itself
in the rubber, it becoming difficult to separate it, which, however,
is necessary; the proteine or albuminous matter is the
cause of the developing of the bacteria which occasion the
putrefaction of the manufactured article.</p>

<p>The method employed in Brazil in the extraction of the latex
and in the preparation of rubber from the heveas trees, is the
same as that which was taught by the natives and it is a remarkable
thing, that due to the excellency of the product resulting
therefrom, it is considered even to-day as the best system.</p>

<p>The great production of rubber in Brazil, is due to the exploitation
of the natural seringaes. A “seringal” or, better said
“seringaes” in the plural sense, are the forests where the hevea
trees flourish among other numerous specimens of luxuriant
vegetation, and in those regions everybody, i.e., all the able-bodied
men, occupy themselves with the extraction of rubber
and are known as “seringueiros.”</p>

<p>In order to exploit the “seringal,” operations are commenced
by the construction on the bank of the river, at a place easy of
access for navigation, of a large rustic edifice with out-buildings
and various sheds. The general edifice serves as a dwelling-place
for the owner or his representative and includes a general
store or shop with a tavern which does business in selling all
the necessary articles required in or connected with the life
of exploiting the “seringal,” a store-house for depositing the
rubber and an office or counting-house. The sheds are the
rudimentary habitation-huts of the “seringueiros” and are sometimes
constructed in the interior of the forests, so as to facilitate
to a greater degree the work which they have in hand.</p>

<p>As soon as the forest is explored and the seringueiras discovered,
<b>estrades</b> are opened, these being winding roads cut in
the undergrowth and brush-wood with the “facão” (a species of
large pruning-knife) and these roads connect a 100 or 150 rubber
trees and they lead back to their original starting point. At
sunrise, that is to say, at 6 o’clock in the morning, the seringueiro
armed with a “terçado” a sort of spear, a fowling-piece
or sporting-gun, a small axe or hatchet, a pail and a large number
of “tigelinhas,” commences his work. The hatchet is the
instrument employed for tapping the trees; it takes the form
of a common pole-axe, being, however, generally of cast iron
and with the edge of the blade blunt rather than sharp, and
from 3 to 4 centimetres broad. The tigelinhas are small vessels
or cups of tin-plate with a capacity of about one hundred
grammes and of a conical shape cut off at the top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p>The seringueiro commences by striking the trees with the
hatchet, whose handle is about a metre long, which permits of
his making incisions at about from 3 to 3½ metres from the
ground. That operation has for its object to make the latex
ascend from the roots; the milk that oozes out is utilized as
“sernamby.” Two days afterwards, the regular extraction commences,
a hatchet with a shorter handle being then used.</p>

<p>To bring this extraction about, “seringueiro” makes the
first incision at two metres from the ground, but those incisions
must not pierce the cambium and the wood and are as a general
rule made at an inclination of 25°. At the lower part of the
incisions made by the blows, the “tigelinhas” are fixed, whose
sharp and cutting corner penetrates easily into the bark of the
tree. The seringueiro operates thus upon all the trees of his
road, and this work which occupies him about from 2 to 3 hours
being completed, he takes the pail capable of holding 10 litres
and recommences his round, gathering into that receptacle the
milk contained in the tapping cups, which now empty are boxed
one into the other and deposited close to the trunk of each tree.</p>

<p>After that second round and in order that the milk shall not
become deteriorated, commences the most delicate operation,
that of the smoking process.</p>

<p>For that operation, the seringueiro is supplied with a
“boião,” a kind of earthen funnel-shaped chimney, a form
made like a spatula or putty-knife and a kind of basin “cuia,”
like a dry gourd, made from the half of the fruit of the
cabaceiro (crescencia cuyeté).</p>

<p>The fire made with blocks of urucury (Ataléa speciosa
Martius) or with fire-wood of massaranduba, rich in oily substances,
being kindled, the seringueiro places the “boião” upon
it, the function of this latter being to canalize the smoke so that
it escapes at the top, which is open.</p>

<p>Through the loop of a cord hanging near to the “boião” the
form is passed and sustained by the “seringueiro” who gives
it a gyratory movement; with the “cuya” or gourd, he pours
the latex into the part scooped out of the spatula, which he
carries off immediately to the smoke. The latex thickens and
forming a thin skin upon the which another coating of latex is
poured out, which is also passed to the smoke. Those successive
and alternate operations form the skins, large balls of rubber,
weighing from 20 to 60 kilos, which are the type exported from
Brazil. The smoke acting as a solidifyer and at the same time
a disinfectant by the presence of creosote, acetic acid, etc., kills
all the bacteria that produce putrefaction and hastens by its heat
the evaporation of the water.</p>

<p>The rubber thus formed is of a superior quality, but when,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
however, the curds still deposited in the basin, are incorporated
with it, the quality becomes damaged, being then quoted as
medium fine. The portion of milk which remains adhering to
the receptacle or which surrounds the boião and which thickens
freely, is reunited into one single skin, and constitutes the
“sernamby.”</p>

<p>On the following day the work recommences, the seringueiro
making new incisions about 7 centimetres below the first, and
continuing thus until he reaches the ground.</p>

<p>To that series of blows in the vertical sense, 35 on the
average, is given the name arreação. In each seringueira 2
of these arreações can be made per year.</p>

<p>That process which with small variations is employed in all
Amazonia, produces, as is known, the best rubber in the world.
A seringal may contain in accordance with its size from 40
to 800 roads. Each seringueiro exploits 2 roads; in which he
works alternatively. The daily gathering varies between 2
and 8 litres of milk, but an average of 5 litres can be taken
for a road which contains 120 seringueiras of 35 centimetres
diametre. As each arreação has 35 incisions and the seringueiras
supporting 2 “arreações,” we have thus for each road 70 days or
140 days for the 2 roads; 700 litres of milk produce 400 kilos
or in other words 1.666 grammes per tree.</p>

<p>There are “seringaes,” however, in which that average is
considerably greater, a medium of 3 kilos per tree not being an
exaggeration in some rivers.</p>

<p>Contrary to the almost sedentary life of the seringueiros, the
extractors of the caucho (known as caucheiros) are of nomadic
habits, and this is so by reason of the barbarous process employed
in the exploitation of those trees which is a ruinous one.</p>

<p>The extraction of the latex of the “castillôa” can be done in
the same way as that of the latex of the heveas; the caucheiros
allege, however, that the cupim introducing itself into the
wounds made by the incisions soon causes the death of the
plant. Thus they argue that if the tree is condemned, the best
way is to cut it down so as to obtain the greatest benefit possible
out of it, by the complete utilization of the latex which each
tree contains. That reasoning, however, has no foundation
in fact.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The exploitation of the castillôa is done in the following
manner: the “caucheiro” penetrates into the forest and marks
each castillôa tree that he finds, with a cut from his knife, which
incisions correspond to a sign of possession for extraction later
on. Once he has discovered a certain number of these trees, he
constructs a temporary wooden hut for himself and then begins<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
his work. In the first place he clears the brush-wood around
each tree and cleans away the undergrowth from the ground, he
then opens small cavities in the lower part of the trunk into
which he fixes the “porringers,” small vessels made of tin, which
are to receive the latex. This done he strikes the tree with
oblique “entalhas” of from 1 to 1½ metres in length, canalizing
the latex which commences to run from the extensive wounds, by
means of mud gutters. At the end of 24 hours the little tin
vessels are full and their contents are then all poured into a pail,
the “caucheiro” commencing thereafter to cut down the tree,
so as to get the full benefit of the latex, existing in the superior
part of its trunk. The tree as a general rule is cut at a point
above that where the incisions were made, the tree thus remaining
suspended above the ground at one end by the lower
part of the trunk, where it remains fixed and at the other
by its own branches. Along the whole length of the trunk at
about a distance of an arm’s length from each other, new circular
incisions are made and in corresponding cavities on the
ground are placed the receiving cups. The latex thus gathered
is collected into a pail.</p>

<p>The thickening is done with a solution of common soap
about 125 grammes to a pail of water, two pailfuls of that solution
being necessary to thicken 30 litres of latex. They also
employ the juice of a liane called <b>vetilla</b> which by the description
given seems to belong to the convolvulas family—the <b>Ipomea
patatas</b>.</p>

<p>The thickening process takes place in rectangular holes of
1 metre long and half a metre broad, whose clayey sides are
well paved and into them the latex is poured, care being taken
that it is then covered up with palm leaves to prevent the entry
of rain water. They thus obtain the caucho planks (rubber in
cakes), which arrive in the market full of impurities, that depreciate
its value very much and it is not at all a rare thing
that water exists in cavities in the interior of it, thereby increasing
the weight and making the transport dearer.</p>

<p>The portions of the latex which flow out along the length
of the trunk or fall into the cavities after that the cups have
been taken away, thicken itself freely and form the “sernamby”
of caucho, to-day much appreciated in the rubber markets, because
of its being purer and not offering errors in weight.</p>

<p>Each adult tree furnishes on the average from 50 to 56 litres
of latex or in other words nearly 30 kilos of rubber. Each cake
of the size above mentioned weighs nearly 60 kilos; it is thus
necessary to cut down three trees so as to obtain one cake.</p>

<p>The trees cut down sprout and commence to grow again, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
eight years are necessary to elapse before they can be exploited
anew.</p>

<p>No accord has so far been established as to the best methods
of extraction to be employed for the different species of maniçoba,
nor as to the period most appropriate, the duration of the
tapping or the yield of the wild trees or planted trees of different
ages.</p>

<p>The system adopted for the natural maniçoba, consisting in
the tapping of the subterranean organs, has been applied to cultivated
maniçoba; the incisions are made in a transversal sense
and have the form of a V with the angle more or less rounded.</p>

<p>The latex is gathered in the ground, at the bottom of a small
cavity, opened up on the occasion of the discovery of the parts
destined to be tapped; as a rule the worker covers the bottom
of the cavity with a coat of clay in powder, in order to prevent
the penetration of the latex and its mixing with the sandy
soil; the employment of tigelinhas is desirable or of pots of
glazed clay, refractory to rust.</p>

<p>The latex thickens during the day, forming a sort of flat
ball or biscuit of rubber, which goes on augmenting as the
tapping process is multiplied. At the end of a week the rubber
which has been obtained, is gathered together and washed in
cold water, with a view of eliminating the remains of the serum
and other impurities. This method, although primitive, permits
of the production of pure rubber. The trunks and branches
of the maniçoba are also cut; however, such system occasions
great inconvenience. The extensive flaws heal up with difficulty,
as the bark of the tree is relatively thin the lactiferous
vessels are located in the deep layers; it is not a rare thing
that the death of the tree is caused thereby or that the attack
of rodent insects or mushrooms is thereby facilitated. It may
be of importance to note, that the incisions made simultaneously
on the trunk, the branches and the underground parts, speedily
exhaust the maniçobeiras; and so the system of an alternate
cutting is preferable.</p>

<p>The tappings are practiced during the first six months of the
year and extend themselves over a period of from 50 to 60 days.
Owing to the lack of data, the average yield of production, which
varies according to the age of the trees, cannot be determined,
however, the average production of the planted maniçobas may
under reserve, be calculated to reach during the space of 60 days
120, 180, 240, and 300 grammes per tree of 2, 3, 4 and 5 years
respectively, in accordance with a calculation made by Dr. L.
Zehnter.</p>

<p>The actual cost price in the plantations does not exceed 1$500
per kilo, and might be reduced through an improvement in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
systems employed; the cost price of rubber from the native maniçoba
is higher, due to the dearness of labor and of freights.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>There is so far no process which may be called the best for
extracting rubber from the mangabeira; the process in use varies
with the region, all of them, however, leading to the complete
extinction of the plant.</p>

<p>Under the pretext of the cupim destroying the plant, attacking
the incisions that have been made, the latex is usually
extracted at a small height from the ground. In the “sertões”
or wild woodlands of Bahia, Pernambuco and Parahyba, the
extraction is done by making a spiral cutting from the thickest
branches to the ground, where the cavity is made for receiving
the latex.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the incisions with the cup attached is now
being employed, in the same manner as is customary with the
seringueira; for that purpose, the exploiters make horizontal
incisions or in shape of a V, with a small instrument called an
<b>alegre</b>, penetrating the entire coating of the bark, in the full
length of the trunk, from the thickest branches down to the
base, about 45 centimetres distance one from another.</p>

<p>The latex is thickened, sometimes simply with water in the
proportion of 3 to 1, and at other times with chlorate of sodium
alone, or with a mixture of alum, as is customary in Bahia and
in S. Paulo, or now again by the action of alum-stone, double
sulphate of aluminium and of potassium as is done in Pernambuco,
Parahyba, and Rio Grande do Norte. All those processes
present serious inconveniences, such as the entry of water
augmenting the weight, the baneful effects and dampness arising
from the use of a large proportion of salt, or the loss of elasticity
due to the last mentioned process, which turns the rubber cracky
and resinous. The smoking process seems in every way to
be advisable whenever the richness of the milky-latex in rubber
is perfectly comparable to that of the hevea.</p>

<p>Whilst it is affirmed that the production per tree is from 3
to 5 kilogrammes it is more prudent to calculate the average
capacity of each tree as at 1 kilogramme.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_ECONOMIC_ORGANIZATION_OF_RUBBER_EXPLOITATION">THE ECONOMIC ORGANIZATION OF RUBBER EXPLOITATION</h3>

</div>

<p>The economic organization of the exploitation of rubber in
the Amazonic valley still remains in its rudimentary condition,
continuing almost exactly on the same lines as those adopted
when the production of this article—one of the principal sources
of the wealth of Brazil—first began to open up.</p>

<p>This unaltered condition of affairs in the modifying of the
economical processes, is the consequence of the continuance of
certain conditions such as the existence of vast regions still
entirely unexplored, the progressive penetration of the seringueiros
guided by the course of the rivers into far away regions
where rapid means of communication are completely lacking,
the scarcity of labor, and the necessity of capital being embarked
in the extraction of rubber.</p>

<p>The régime of private property is still limited, and does not
extend beyond a few kilometres into the Interior, starting from
the banks of the rivers, since the greater part of the lands still
continue to be the property of the States either of Amazonas or
of Pará, and—in the territory of the Acre—of the Federal
Government.</p>

<p>With the object of peopling the rubber-producing regions
endeavors are being made to facilitate the acquiring of properties
by furnishing their owners with adequate guarantees of
protection, special Public Departments having already been
created in the State of Amazonas and Pará devoted to the fiscalization
of the régime of lands; and the régime of lands in the
Acre Territory is about to be regulated at once by the Federal
Government in accordance with the determinations set forth in
the new economic measure known as the Rubber Defense Act.</p>

<p>The proprietory question originated itself in the concession
of lands granted under certain conditions such as that of its
effective exploitation and cultivation, colonization, etc., and by
the legitimation of the possession. These last were established
in the following manner:</p>

<p>The explorer who penetrated into the forest in search of
seringaes, examined the banks of the river by which he went
up and when he verified the existence of a favorable zone, he
landed and after a careful exploration under the direction of
specialist-workmen called “matteiros” (foresters) he settled
down and gave himself up to the exploitation of the “seringal” he
selected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>That occupation of virgin ground and its being made use of
constituted the act of possession, the first step towards acquiring
the property. In order to definitely assure the dominion of
the lands selected, it became necessary to obtain a title of ownership
from the Government of the State in which these lands
were located, this being drawn up only after that the respective
marking out and survey by an authorized engineer or surveyor,
the depositing of the respective plans, the verification
that no anterior rights or claims existed on the part of third
parties, as also the payment of the respective taxes being satisfied,
which last averaged about 5$000 per hectare.</p>

<p>Only after that all these formalities had been complied with,
was the concession granted definitely, and the possession considered
as complete. The title deeds of the property with the
respective specifications is registered in special blocks, which
will serve as proof in case of future dispute and will furnish
authentic documents in place of the property-titles that may
have been mislaid or lost. Once the concession is legalized and
the possession marked out, the property rights are considered
irrefutable.</p>

<p>The dominion of the lands being assured, their usefulness
will depend upon the co-existence of two essential factors—labor
and capital.</p>

<p>In the regions of the Amazonian valley, sparingly peopled
by the want of direct immigration, the work is done by the
natives and principally by Cearenses, people from Ceará.</p>

<p>Under the general designation of <b>Cearenses</b> are comprised
the populations of the northeast of the country from Bahia to
Piauhy, a strong race endowed with rare energy. Having
immigrated from their native state fleeing from privations to
which the periodical dry seasons reduce them, they arrive completely
without the means of subsistence, it being necessary for
the owners of the “seringas” who contract their services to take
measures for their transport, alimentation and maintenance in the
seringaes until with the delivery of the rubber collected, they
find themselves in a position to liquidate the debts that they
have contracted and the expenses that have been occasioned.</p>

<p>On the other hand in their turn the owners of seringaes not
disposing of capital are placed under the necessity of raising
loans with which to defray the exploitation of their lands. These
resources are furnished them by the traders, part in money and
part in merchandise, these traders being known as <b>aviadores</b>
whilst the proprietors are called patrons or aviados.</p>

<p>The extensive credits opened by the traders constitute acts of
confidence, being guaranteed more by the activity and initiative
of the proprietors of the seringaes, than by their respective<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
properties; the heavy burdens with which these loanings or
advances of money are weighed down, have their origin in the
risk which is run by advancing such capital, due to the difficulties
of collecting the debts contracted and the far distant
nature of the lands given in guarantee. It frequently happens
that the traders do not dispose of sufficient means for carrying
out all these lending operations in which case they fall back
upon the exporting houses, who advance them the necessary
money, against a contract to hand over the rubber at a certain
date and at prices previously fixed.</p>

<p>Thus is established a successive dependency of the seringueiro
on the owner of the property, this latter in his turn on the
merchant-trader and finally of the merchant-trader upon the
exporting house.</p>

<p>Thereafter it is seen how grievously the system of want of
capital acts on the whole system on the exportation of rubber
and the long series of intermediaries.</p>

<p>Let us see now what is the capital which the owner of the
seringal requires to possess for an exploitation of say 200 roads.</p>

<p>A seringal with 200 roads exacts altogether the work of 100
men, whose engagements in the region where they reside and
their transport as far as the “seringal” costs on an average
40:000$000 and to each one of them is supplied a sum of 350$000
destined to defray the costs of purchase of the indispensable
material for making a commencement with the work of exploitation;
out of an initial sum estimated at from 75:000$000 to
80:000$000 including casual expenses.</p>

<p>Arrived at their destination, the seringueiros, as they find
themselves completely without means, continue to be a burden
on the budget of their contractors during the period of the clearing
the forests of brush-wood and undergrowth, and the cutting
of roads, which are the preliminaries to the gathering in of the
rubber. Up till the date of the final delivery, which takes place
from 6 to 7 months afterwards, the proprietor expends nearly
100:000$000 with the feeding and maintenance of the seringueiros,
which is but the preface to a total sum of 180:000$000
inscribed on the books of the aviador or merchant-trader as
being the indebtedness of the owner of the seringal.</p>

<p>This latter in order to meet the charges of the up-keep of the
seringueiros, establishes “vendas” or selling-stores, by means of
which he supplies not only the goods of first necessity for consumption,
but also the tools, utensils and, indeed, everything
that is required for the proper exploitation of the “seringal.”</p>

<p>These “vendas” or supply-stores are stocked by the merchant-trader
of Belém and Manáos, who send them periodically
in steamers or steam launches, the necessary merchandise. According<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
to the season of the year, the rainy or the dry season,
the greater or less the distance to be navigated, in short, in
accordance with the condition of navigability of the rivers, the
trips are made fortnightly, quarterly or perhaps only twice a
year.</p>

<p>The merchandise dispatched is debited to the owner of the
“seringal” at the invoice price, augmented by the high expenses
for insurance, freight and a commission which varies from
20 to 30 per cent according to the time-term stipulated for the
payment in cash or the delivery of the rubber.</p>

<p>The owner of the “seringal” in his turn re-sells in retail the
merchandise received, putting on a high profit to its original
price; the seringueiros who already pay interest at the rate of
20 per cent upon the advance of the 350$000 which is made to
them at the time of their being contracted, are obliged to supply
their needs exclusively in the store of the proprietor of the
“seringal” and to hand him the rubber which they may have
gathered in payment thereof.</p>

<p>The initial supplying of the utensils amounting to 200$000
added to the cost of the journey which runs for account of the
seringueiro himself, absorb the 350$000 of the advance; and
his expenses, whilst the extraction of the rubber is proceeding—which
lasts for 6 or 7 months—totals up to about
1:000$000, so that when he comes to hand over the rubber, he
is already responsible to the proprietor of the “seringal” for an
amount of about 350$000 including the payment for the renting
of the road explored.</p>

<p>His production being on an average of about 400 kilos (in
certain regions it is much greater), the worker finishes his enterprise
with a very small profit and it is not a rare case that he
is not able to satisfy all his indebtedness, a circumstance, this
latter, which keeps him continually dependent upon the owner
of the “seringal.”</p>

<p>On handing over the rubber, the conditions of payment are
adjusted and these are generally made in one of the two following
ways: either the seringueiro sells the rubber directly to
the proprietor of the “seringal” at a reduction of one-third upon
the prices ruling in the markets of Belém or Manáos; or he encharges
him to sell it in the referred-to market with a discount
of 35 kilos of rubber or with a discount of from 10 to 15 per cent
of the net price of such sale, given in payment of the renting of
the road exploited.</p>

<p>This defective economic organization of the exploitation of
rubber has, as its consequence, the high costs of production
which to-day oscillate between 3$000 to 3$500 per kilo. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
disadvantageous situation, however, is not a permanent one and
may be remedied.</p>

<p>We shall leave for a special chapter the explanation of the
means recently adopted for bettering the condition of the seringueiros,
augmenting their productive capacity and recompensing
them more justly for their work.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak" id="TRANSPORTS_AND_FREIGHTS">TRANSPORTS AND FREIGHTS</h3>

</div>

<p>The problem of transports and freight continues to be one of
the most palpitating questions in Brazil, notwithstanding the
great progress in this particular made during the last 10 years.</p>

<p>The considerable increase in the mercantile marine and the
incessant construction of the numerous railroads of penetration,
have not been able to keep pace with the extraordinary development
of the country and its notable economic expansion, the
national commerce continuing to feel the want of further means
of transport and to suffer from the very high rates of freights.</p>

<p>In Amazonia, the difficulty of communication has become
still more felt because of the vast region and territories embraced
in this great State, sparingly peopled and whose centres
of production are located so far distant from the exporting markets
of Manáos and Belém de Pará.</p>

<p>Watered in every direction by innumerable great rivers,
tributaries of the great river—the Amazon—the greatest in the
world, the Amazonic region still remains to a very great part
unexplored, inestimable riches susceptible of being extracted,
lying unutilized, in virtue of the deficiency in navigation; in fact,
if the principal rivers are navigated regularly to some extent,
even though sparingly, others leading to immensely rich regions
are very rarely navigated by either ship or boats, which might
assure the transport of the products gathered.</p>

<p>Many and divers are the circumstances which concur towards
bringing about this state of affairs, but the most important in
resumé is that of the want of capital for the construction of
ships and the establishment of regular lines of fluvial navigation
as also the obstacles offered either by the irregular courses of
some rivers obstructed by waterfalls, shoots and rapids, or simply
obstructed by the trunks of trees and other materials or by the
diminutive volume of water during the dry seasons which makes
impossible navigation of even ordinary draught.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting phases of the Amazonian problem
is, however, in the regulating and increasing of the navigation
of the rivers, with the object of assuring ample transport facilities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
and the approximation to the centres of production with the
consuming markets. The opening up of the ways of fluvial communication
is an essential condition to the progress of the
Amazonic region, by the lesser expenditure required by transport
upon water in comparison with land transportation which in
those regions would be particularly difficult and costly.</p>

<p>The steamers and boats which set out from Manáos or Belém
for the Interior, make the passage generally, over-charged with
merchandise which by reason of accumulation and its defective
packing suffers not rarely serious damages which has the result
of bringing about a notable increment in prices. As a general
rule the cargo being greater than the space requisite to its
accommodation, makes the navigation extremely difficult, the
steamers thus not being able to make head-way against the current,
which flows at the rate of from 3 to 5 miles an hour, or
desiring to diminish the expense in the consumption of coal,
seek out the waters the less agitated and approach as much as
possible the banks of the river.</p>

<p>The want of minute hydrographic charts and the imprudence
of the captains, as also of the masters of steam launches and
other floating material, have, as a consequence, the bringing
about of frequent strandings, which even though they may not
cause damage to the cargo involve interruptions in the trip
sufficiently prejudicial.</p>

<p>The unloadings are made frequently on the banks of the
rivers under little favorable conditions, by reason of the want of
wharves; are very slow and occasion besides lamentable delays,
very heavy expenses principally for the packages of great weight.</p>

<p>One of the causes which most determine the dearness of
transport in Amazonia, is the supply of combustibles to the
steamers, these latter taking in coal only at the port of departure
in Belém or Manáos, and this being consumed, purchase wood
fuel along the route just as they require it, and for a high price,
subjecting themselves thus to the delays incident to loading, at
times very great. Coal mines in the basin of the Caquetá have
been discovered, but so far it has not been possible to derive any
benefit from them, owing to the want of the necessary studies
and analysis, which only now the Federal Government is beginning
to have made.</p>

<p>For the betterment of this state of things the Federal Government
also pretends to contract with a large public company for
the establishment of coal depots and combustible oil, at the most
appropriate points of the rivers on which the greatest movement
takes place in the valley of the Amazon, so that the steamers
may be supplied for prices according to a tabular statement
previously approved for each year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>The descent of the floating material by the rivers is much
less onerous, as the consumption of combustibles is thereby considerably
diminished, thanks to the current which gives an easy
impulsion to the floating material; the trips are notwithstanding
slow, much time being lost in picking up cargo, almost exclusively
rubber, on the banks of the rivers.</p>

<p>The irregularity in the navigation either due to the deficiency
of the floating material or by the natural obstacles that the
flooding of the rivers bring about, cause extensive prejudice, as
it obliges the large cargoes of merchandise upon whose price
high interest is collected and occasions them considerable loss
of goods deteriorated by their remaining for a long time in sheds
and by the damaging effect of heat and dampness.</p>

<p>From thence arises the lamentable dearness of life and the
bad alimentation, with their evil results on the health of the
inhabitants of those far-away-regions.</p>

<p>The retention in the seringaes of large stocks of rubber deprived
of the means of transport must also not be forgotten and
its coming simultaneously on to the market at certain times,
being taken advantage of by speculators is an important cause
of the fall in prices which affects the interests of producers to
an appreciable degree.</p>

<p>Regularity and frequency in navigation, permitting successive
and regular supplies of rubber would diminish in notable proportions
the cost of production, since it would cheapen the cost
of labor and avoid the great oscillations usual in the prices.</p>

<p>In order to obtain that desideratum it is not sufficient to
create new lines of navigation nor to augment the number of
floating material or better their conditions, but it is necessary
to adopt certain complementary measures. Thus in the impossibility
of preparing from the outset minute hydrographic
charts, a measure which would require great expenditure; it were
advisable in order to make navigation more secure to indicate
by means of small light houses and illuminated buoys of acetyline,
the dangerous points which it is desirable to avoid.</p>

<p>In order to obviate the difficulties created by the formation
of sand banks, by the accumulation of trunks of trees, and of
obstacles of all kinds, it is necessary that attention be paid constantly
to the cleansing of the rivers and dragging them, in
cases where the obstructions cannot be removed by other means
and the construction of railways and wagon roads connecting
the navigable points.</p>

<p>It would be of the greatest utility to bring about the extension
and opening up of telegraphic lines joining the producing
centres with the central markets, such measures would have
the most beneficient results as much for the owners of seringaes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
as for the shipowners, these latter being once aware of such
facilities would cause their ships to be directed to the points
where they were required to discharge merchandise or take in
rubber or vice-versa and thus avoid all uncertainty upon the
advantages to be reaped from those trips, because of the want
of knowledge of the cargoes that are being reserved for them,
and those who are in contact with them in the markets where
the product is sold may be advised as to the quotations and the
market prices of the merchandise so that they may take advantage
of the most favorable times for effecting their transactions.</p>

<p>The message presented by His Excellency Marchal Hermes
da Fonseca, President of the Republic of the United States of
Brazil on the third of May of this current year, made special
reference to the services of the radio-telegraph in the territory of
the Acre, expressing himself in the following terms:</p>

<p>“The three radio-telegraphic stations that have been contracted
for in December of 1910, are now in full working order,
those of the Rio Branco and Senna Madueira having been inaugurated
in September of 1911 and in February of this year
that of Cruzeiro de Sul, which besides speaking with those two
and therefore with Manáos, communicates also with Iquitos in
the Republic of Perú.”</p>

<p>In order to complete this very useful improvement ordered to
be done in such a happy hour, there were also contracted for
two other stations, one of these being in Xapury and the other
in Tarauacá, places having a great future before them and already
containing an appreciable population as well as a notable material
development.</p>

<p>With the installation of those two stations, the territory will
be perfectly well equipped in regard to the question of telegraphic
communications.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the dearness and the difficulties in the
means of transport we get the excessive rises in freight, which
at times are equal to and are often greater than the value
of the merchandise transported; the truth is that the crisis in
rubber made them suffer a certain fall and we no longer see such
a thing happen as that the shipowner pays for the price of his
steamers in two round trips.</p>

<p>The dominating principle is that of liberty of commerce. In
order to assure regular services on the principal rivers, the
Federal Government as well as the Governments of the States of
Amazonas and Pará subsidize certain companies whose tables of
freight charges are approved by the Public Powers. That these
are still very high is shown by the fact of competition which
in certain lines takes place between the subsidized companies
and private shipowners; the latter, however, not being able to go<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
beyond the tariff tables of the former, they nevertheless obtain
freights and passengers which proportion them high profits,
demonstrating thus that the tables of freight tariffs of the subsidized
companies are still a long way from the maximum of
reduction.</p>

<p>The Commercial, Industrial and Agricultural Congress which
took place in Manáos from the 22nd to 27th of February of
1910, considering this position, resolved to recommend to the
Public Powers the remodelling of the actual freight tariffs
principally in that part of them which relate to alimentary goods,
necessary to the sustaining of the extractors of rubber and in
the sense of their being substantially cheapened.</p>

<p>Even to-day one of the best businesses in the Amazonic
regions consists in chartering steamers for trafficking on the
rivers.</p>

<p>If the freight rates on the sections served by the subsidized
lines are high, greater still are these on the less favored sections
where the rapids of the rivers flowing among the seringaes,
make navigation difficult, because in these latter there being no
freight tables, they make the price according to their judgment,
such prices of transport being contracted directly according to
the circumstances of the occasion with the shipper, who has to
pay the price as the masters of the steamers are pleased or resolved
to charge.</p>

<p>The owners of seringaes subject themselves to the heavy
burdens which they are bound to put up with, in the hope of
escaping the damage that the retention of their produce for
want of transport would cause them.</p>

<p>It is not only the fluvial navigation freights that are much
too burdensome, for the freights for ocean navigation are also
burdened with this grave defect and thus it is that despite the
fact of the distance which separate Brazil from New York and
from London, is only half that between the consuming markets
and the east, the freights for the latter are incomparably
less. It behooves the Governments of countries producing
rubber in South America to come to an arrangement so as to
confer adequate premiums on the navigation companies to
Europe and to the United States, who cheapen their freights
and cut down in a satisfactory manner the duration of the
voyage.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="INTERNAL_MARKETS_FOR_RUBBER">INTERNAL MARKETS FOR RUBBER—ORGANIZATION AND WORKING—TYPES
AND QUOTATIONS</h3>

</div>

<p>Located in the centre of the most important rubber producing
region of the world, Belém and Manáos, the capitals of
the two great states of the north, are, in Brazil, the principal
markets of that product. Nearly 90 per cent of the Brazilian
exportation proceeds from there, the 16,000 tons of rubber
which each of these markets export annually gives place to a
considerable mass of business.</p>

<p>If it be true that the commercial transactions gyrate around
equal quantities of rubber, Belém has the advantage over
Manáos, because it is the seat of a great part of the large exporting
houses that operate in the two capitals. Its geographical
situation which permits of more rapid communication with the
markets of the south, and with foreign ports, contributes also
towards its greater commercial importance.</p>

<p>The uses and customs are identical in the two markets.
Commerce obeys a rule above all unfavorable to the sellers who
cannot put a value on their merchandise but are forced before
all things to accept the price imposed by the buyers. That disadvantageous
condition of dependency is the natural outcome of
the deficient economic organization in the exploitation of the
rubber industry in the valley of the Amazon. Reference has
already been made in another place to the burdensome commercial
relations between the seringueiros and the patrons or
proprietors of seringaes and between the same patrons and
the commercial traders. The same vices and defects are to
be found in the relations between the commercial traders and
the great exporting houses. Those latter, possessors of large
capital and united together in the common interests, dominate
the market, which, weakened by successive crises and always
in a precarious state cannot oppose them an efficacious resistance.</p>

<p>That situation can only be modified in the case of the actual
economic and commercial methods, which place in the hands of
the merchant-trader all the responsibility of the conduction of
business in the place, without at the same time arming them
with the means of defence against unrestricted speculations.</p>

<p>The merchant-trader’s houses are the intermediaries between
the seringueiros and the exporting houses. But, their principal
function is that of furnishing the seringueiro during the year<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
all the goods necessary to sustain him and his employes as well
as supplying him with tools, utensils, wearing apparel and in
fact, everything that may be necessary to his life in the
seringaes.</p>

<p>This supplying is done on credit, that is to say, against the
remittance of rubber produced by the borrower and which is
sold on its arrival by the merchant-trader to the exporting
houses.</p>

<p>The merchant-trader thus requires large capital so as to meet
the engagements that he assumes in the market with the great
and numerous supplies, which he is obliged to make.</p>

<p>It is incumbent on him also to transport the same for which
he nearly always employs steamers of his own, in order to bring
the merchandise to its destination in far-away regions, bringing
back on the return trip the rubber collected by his aviados, i.e.,
his borrowers of the seringaes.</p>

<p>The responsibilities assumed become due on the occasion of
the arrival of the cargoes of rubber. In fact, it is exactly at
this moment that the merchant-trader is most in need of
money, because besides the imperious duty of paying the
amount of his debts and the immediate necessity which he has of
furnishing new supplies to his clients the aviados, he has still
yet expenses to disburse with the repair and fitting out of the
steamers, which owing to the bad conditions in the navigation
of the rivers return nearly always in a damaged condition;
balances to pay to the seringueiros whose debts were relatively
small or advances to make to those whose production was inferior
in value to the supply sent, but who required a new resource
under the danger of otherwise not being able ever to
liquidate their debt.</p>

<p>Thus it is that the aviador or merchant-trader has no other
remedy, but to sell without delay the rubber which has been
consigned to him and that is the psychological moment for the
decided action of the buyers.</p>

<p>Reduced as to number, well informed about the business
and in the possession of daily and direct notices from the consuming
markets, perfectly bound up to them by a question of
mutual interest, they decide to make the price for the merchandise
that is offered to them. It is not always that that price
corresponds in reality to those of the foreign market, but the
apprehension that seizes the merchant-trader that moved by their
interests the buyers may resolve to retire the offer, does not
permit him either to hesitate or resist. He hands over the merchandise
with a small profit and not uncommonly with a loss.</p>

<p>Treating of an article which up till to-day has been produced
in a quantity inferior to the necessity of the industry, whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
price was kept up high, much above that which might be called
a remunerative price, that inversion of the law of economics is
a very curious one, because, in this case, it is not the producer
who imposes the price, but the buyer who does so.</p>

<p>The difficulties which the merchant-trader had to fight
against, have been increased lately with the advent of the
“regatões,” a species of barter-commission travelers on the rivers.
This trade is exercised by individuals acting for their own account
or as agents of the merchants and who go up the rivers
with merchandise, doing business at sight in exchange for
money or rubber, diverting in this way a large part of the transactions
until now exercised through the inter-medium of the
merchant-traders.</p>

<p>The principal causes of the precarious position of the
“aviadores” or merchant-traders are the lack of adequate capital
and the want of banking facilities and other establishments of
credit which might come to their aid.</p>

<p>The export houses, however, operate with the greatest firmness.
They discount the drafts for the rubber bought, in the
agencies of the English banks, and with the product of this
operation pay the merchant-traders, and as these drafts are at
90 days sight, it is only after the rubber is sold in New York
or in Liverpool that they satisfy their indebtedness, thus trafficking
almost covered from any risk whatsoever.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The aviador or merchant-trader receives the rubber by the
weight which it shows at the moment of being unloaded; if the
trip is a long one the shortage in weight of the rubber may be
as much as 15 per cent; if, on the other hand, there has been
no time, owing to the shortness of the trip, for such a thing to
happen, it is certain that on its being magazined or stored-up,
it will continue to <b>quebrar</b>, i.e., diminish in weight. Thus, therefore,
it is to the interest of all parties concerned to sell it and
export it as soon after its arrival as possible, which, however,
does not mean to say that the question of shortage is not an
element which comes into play in making the estimate of its
value.</p>

<p>The classifying of the rubber is done upon the occasion of
its sale, this being an operation which necessitates a long experience
and practice in the knowledge of the article.</p>

<p>Two workmen with iron instruments which they call “gatos,”
take hold of the skin (smoke-cured roll or ball) by the orifice
which is left in its shape on its being made, at the same time that
a third workman cuts it down the middle with a sharp instrument
called a “traçado.” By this means it is easy to ascertain
if the manufacture of the internal coatings or layers has been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
done with the necessary care, and if the weight has been affected
by water, or by any other extraneous body.</p>

<p>If the rubber presents itself with an uniform aspect, perfectly
smoked and sufficiently elastic, it is classed “fina.” If,
however, any points present spongy parts proceeding from
coagulation of the latex anterior to the smoking process, it is
styled “entre-fina.” To the agglomeration of residue which congeals
freely, the name of “sernamby” is given.</p>

<p>There is still the “borracha fraca” little elastic, whose
mercantile value is put in the same category as “sernamby” and
which does not come from the latex of the hevea.</p>

<p>This work being finished, the rubber is bought in accordance
with the quotations of the day, based upon prices coming from
England and from the United States, but as has already been
explained, this quotation is not always respected.</p>

<p>There is another anomaly to which it is advisable to refer:
whilst the “entre-fina” and the sernamby are quoted abroad at
least at 200 réis and 1$800 réis less than the “fina” the markets
of Belém and Manáos show a difference of 800 réis and 2$000.</p>

<p>There are other abuses which also take place in the classifying
of the rubber, which gives as a result that the buyers prefer
to do business upon inferior qualities, because these offer a
larger margin for profits.</p>

<p>The rubber is exported in American pineboxes which can
hold nearly 150 Kilos. The dearness of manual labor in the
Amazon territory makes it difficult to take advantage of the
innumerable species of timber-woods in which the valley of the
great river is so abundantly rich.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In the remaining markets of the country where the rubber is
negotiated, the price is regulated by the quotations in Pará.
These local markets are of little importance and in nothing do
they distinguish themselves as to the relative transactions in
rubber, from the general mass of business. The class of <b>aviadores</b>
or merchant-trader does not exist. Each producer sends his
stock to his agent or representative or sells it to the first buyer.
The rubber is collected from either maniçoba or mangabeira.</p>

<p>In the commerce of those products, the markets of Bahia and
Fortaleza stand out the most prominently, to which places a certain
appreciable portion of cultivated plantation rubber converges
every year besides a great quantity of native rubber.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="ECONOMIC_AND_FINANCIAL_IMPORTANCE">ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL IMPORTANCE—FEDERAL AND STATE REVENUE—EXPORTATION TAX</h3>

</div>

<p>The most superficial examination of the actual economic position
of Brazil demonstrates at once and in an incisive manner
how important the rubber industry is to the national life of the
country.</p>

<p>Possessor of the innumerable riches distributed by the three
Kingdoms of Nature, it is almost exclusively due to the cultivation
of coffee and to the extraction of rubber that Brazil owes
its extraordinary commercial development in these last twenty
years.</p>

<p>The great fortunes which the plantations of the famous red-bean
of the coffee-tree created in the South and the considerable
profits which the exploitation of the precious gum have produced
in the North, were certainly the causes which most influenced
the development of the production to such an extraordinary
degree, relegating to a much lower schedule in the general
tabular statement of Brazilian exportation, all the products,
whose commerce although certainly remunerative, does not show
such certain and speedy results.</p>

<p>The general exportation of Brazilian merchandise was £63,724,440
in 1909, £63,091,547 in 1910 and £66,838,982 in 1911. To
these totals, coffee and rubber contributed during each of the
same three years £52,401,276, £51,342,278 and £55,458,221 respectively—totals
these, sufficient by themselves, to guarantee
with advantage the Brazilian international commercial equilibrium,
when it is seen that in those said same years, the general
importation of merchandise amounted to £37,139,354, £47,871,974
and £52,798,016.</p>

<p>Rubber contributed to the general total of exportation with
29.70 per cent in 1909, 39.06 per cent in 1910 and 22.53 per cent
in 1911, or in other words an average of 30.43 per cent per annum.
It is worthy of note, that the great difference which took
place in the above-mentioned percentages is explained in
the fluctuations in the prices of rubber, since the production not
only did not decrease, but, as a matter of fact, increased from
year to year. Therefore it is seen that nearly one-third of Brazil’s
export trade is supplied by rubber, and it is nearly twenty
millions of pounds sterling that Brazil receives every year, and
which goes far to provide for the sustentation, not only of the
population of the Brazilian Northwest, comprised in the great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
States of Pará, Amazons and Matto-Grosso and the Federal Territory
of the Acre, but for the prosperity of the North-east
States, which get the benefit of a good part of that sum
through the intermedium of their sons, who live by the exploitation
of the rubber; the Southern States benefit in their turn by
the abundance of money in the North, that most secure guarantee
of their prosperity, since that being producers of cereals, xarque,
coffee, sugar, textile goods, hats and shoes, for a long time already
they have constituted themselves the principal furnishers
of food-stuffs and wearing apparel to that region. Finally there
is still to be considered the benefit to be brought indirectly to
the whole country because that sum goes to increase the commerce
of importation, thus powerfully augmenting the Federal
Customs Revenue.</p>

<p>The sum obtained by the States of the Amazons and Pará and
by the Federal Territory of the Acre, is also considerable every
year by the tribute paid on the rubber going out.</p>

<p>This last Territory of the Acre, since its incorporation with
Brazil by the Treaty of Petropolis concluded with Bolivia in
1903, cost the Union (including the expenses incident to the acquisition
of the Territory and other resulting compromises of the
said treaty, such as the arbitral Tribunal, loans to Bolivia, marking
out of the frontier, construction of the Madeira-Mamoré
Railroad and expenses for the mobilization of troops, etc.),
up till 1909 the sum of Rs. 62,595:562$038; the revenue brought
in during the same period attained the sum of Rs. 58,052:757$012,
in 1910 moreover the tax upon the rubber produced
was Rs. 19,867:529$159 and in 1911 Rs. 9,671:711$068, or in
other words Rs. 29,539:240$227 more, which should be carried
to the credit of that very rich region. The rubber of the Acre
is exported through the intermedium of the markets of Belém
and Manáos, the impost-tax of 20 per cent ad valorem being
collected on the occasion of its shipment.</p>

<p>The States of Amazonas and Pará cannot dispense quickly
without very serious economic disturbance with the revenue
receivable from the tribute paid on the exportation of rubber. As
a matter of fact, the State of Amazonas collected the sum of Rs.
16,845:585$063 in 1909, Rs. 18,069:162$372 in 1910 and Rs. 12,901:477$379
in 1911; the impost-tax upon rubber brought in those
same years respectively Rs. 13,316:487$569, Rs. 14,836:235$238
and Rs. 9,999:031$526, which can also be reckoned by 79.04 per
cent, 82.11 per cent and 77.50 per cent.</p>

<p>The State of Amazonas taxes rubber produced in the State
itself, in 18 per cent ad valorem, and that coming from the Javary,
the boundary river with Perú, in 7 per cent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>In its turn Pará has had in the form of revenue collected in
those years, the amounts of Rs. 19,039:709$531, Rs. 20,255:070$604
and Rs. 14,480:716$176, the import-tax on rubber rendering
Rs. 14,602:759$269, Rs. 14,701:894$955 and Rs. 9,518:716$267,
or 76.69 per cent, 72.58 per cent and 65.73 per cent.</p>

<p>The taxes charged by Pará are 22 per cent ad valorem for
Rubber “fina,” “entre-fina” and “sernamby,” and 15 per cent for
whatever other kind. Besides those there is an additional tax
of 2.5 per cent in benefit of the Santa Casa de Misericordia
charged on the exportation taxes.</p>

<p>These figures seem to show the importance for those
States of questions concerning the production and consumption
of the world’s rubber, and with greater reason still for Brazil
as a whole. The ruin of one of the most promising regions on
the face of the globe, the profound depreciation of Brazilian
finances and the dreaded commercial crisis with which the country
would have to fight, would be the disastrous effect of the
indifference of the Federal and States Governments on such a
matter. But that, however, is not the attitude of those Governments;
they are decreeing various measures now in course of being
carried out and which after minute studies were judged necessary,
so that Brazil might continue to maintain her proud position
of importance for the precious “black gold” (rubber) in
the world’s market.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak" id="RUBBER-CONSUMING_MARKETS">RUBBER-CONSUMING MARKETS—COMPETITION OF OTHER RUBBER-PRODUCING COUNTRIES</h3>

</div>

<p>New York, Liverpool, London, Hamburg, Antwerp and
Havre are at the present time, by their order of importance, the
principal world’s markets for rubber.</p>

<p>New York, by virtue of the extraordinary development of
North American industries, which in a steadily increasing scale,
are consuming constantly greater quantities of raw material, receives
almost half of the rubber produced in all the world.
Nearly 60 per cent of the rubber negotiated in New York is
Brazilian. After this follow Central America and Mexico; but
as rubber proceeding from all parts appears in the New York
market it is evident that there is no specialty in this business.</p>

<p>Liverpool, perhaps due to the fact of its being the port to
which the lines of navigation that run to and from the Amazon
are directed, has become the European emporium for Brazilian
rubber. In fact, 40 per cent of the Brazilian production is directed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
towards that city. Liverpool also receives rubber of various
qualities proceeding from the English and other European
possessions in equatorial Africa.</p>

<p>The increasing production of the Oriental plantations finds in
London one of its principal markets for the precious gum. Although
rubber proceeding from different parts appears in the
market, it may be affirmed without hesitation, that London is
the special centre for cultivated refined rubber (plantation)
which is easily explained by the fact that the owners of the extensive
plantations in the Malay States are nearly all of them
London companies.</p>

<p>Occidental and Oriental Africa, principally German Colonies,
send to Hamburg the greater part of the rubber which is negotiated
on that market. Brazil enters with about 20 per cent of
the total amount of the business.</p>

<p>Antwerp owes its rubber trade to the creation of the Congo
Free State, whose production, now in decline, is practically all
directed to this city. It also receives rubber from Brazil, and
seeing that Belgian capital is employed in the Oriental plantations
its future is promising.</p>

<p>Havre, on the other hand, is of greater importance to Brazil;
where 75 per cent of the transactions are in Brazilian rubber.
It also imports the Congo species, as also those of some
of the French Colonies in Africa. However, the great bulk of
the production of these latter colonies is directed to Bordeaux.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The methods of sale adopted in these markets, vary very
much. From the slow old-fashioned process of sale by private
treaty, to sales on time terms, passing through auctions and underwritings,
in short all the commonly known modes of negotiating
are in use.</p>

<p>The most important market, that of New York, adheres to
the old-fashioned method of personal contracts for immediate delivery,
which certainly serves better the interests of buyers, than
those of sellers; the agitation that was created round this question
with a view to reform the market, gave no result whatsoever.</p>

<p>Liverpool presents us the polymorphic type. Private sales,
and sales on a fixed day for delivery, or sales by auctions, all take
place, consulting thereby the preferences of both sellers and
buyers, and establishing the free course of the values. The same
happens in London, where, however, the Plantation companies
have initiated more advanced transactions, such as sales of crops
in anticipation.</p>

<p>Hamburg and Antwerp also practice sales by auction and on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
delivery. However, in this latter the method of underwriting is
that most in vogue and which among all the processes is the one
that consults most the interest of the seller. This is carried out
in the following manner: A broker advertises a certain quantity
of rubber for sale, the particulars of which he supplies (name of
seller, weight, quality, estimated price, etc.), about twenty days
beforehand. On the day appointed, he receives the offers of purchase
closed and sealed; these are then opened in a public place
and the prices are inscribed on a schedule divided into columns,
each one headed with the name of the house offering. Once this
operation has finished, the rubber falls to the highest bidder. The
seller has, however, the right to withdraw the goods in case the
price that results does not satisfy him.</p>

<p>The Antwerp market adopted this system with the view to
competing against cognate markets. As the reducing of the expenses
on the product, which corresponded to frs. 2.60 per 100
Kilos, the same being frs. 4.93 and frs. 7.30 in Hamburg and Liverpool
respectively, did not suffice, it endeavored to attract the
seller by offering the most advantageous prices, and it seems that
it has succeeded in its desideratum.</p>

<p>Havre followed its example and it is greatly to be desired that
all the rubber markets adopt the same system, not only for the
reasons set forth, but also because it is a safe precaution against
the manipulations of speculators.</p>

<p>Brazil has always maintained its predominating position in
the world’s market for rubber, not only as the greatest producer,
but also as the producer of the best quality.</p>

<p>In 1827, the first year about which statistical data exist,
Brazil exported 31 tons of rubber; in 1837, 289 tons, or say an
increase of 932 per cent; in 1847, 624 tons, or 216 per cent more;
in 1857, 1,800 tons, which corresponds to an increase of 290 per
cent; in 1867, 5,826 tons, or 322 per cent more; 1877, 9,215 tons,
thus augmenting by 158 per cent; in 1887, 13,290 tons, or 144
per cent increase; in 1897, 21,256 tons, representing about 160
per cent more; and, finally, in 1907, 36,490 tons, or approximately
an increase of 172 per cent.</p>

<p>Within the last decade, that is to say, from 1902 to 1911 (vide
statistical statements <b>in fine</b>), the exportation rose gradually to
28,631 tons in 1902 and to 39,026 tons in 1909, the maximum ever
reached so far, to descend immediately to 38,546 tons in 1910 and
36,547 tons in 1911.</p>

<p>Brazil has so far not had any serious competition to fear. It
is true that the other producing countries in Central America,
South Africa and Asia, send a considerable quantity of rubber
on to the market, but this does not affect the Brazilian trade, because,
besides being practically all of it of an inferior quality,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
such extra supply is not sufficient to occasion the harmful effects
of an overproduction. It is curious to observe, that even within
the last decade, the production of those regions which in 1901
was 21,547 tons increased even so far as to surpass the production
of Brazil in the year of 1905, reaching then 35,428 tons; but
it diminished as rapidly as it had increased and in 1911 we see it
reduced to 23,747 tons. This decrease cannot be attributed to
the effects of competition, for instance to the plantations of the
Orient, whose production commenced to accentuate itself exactly
in the year of 1905 and henceforward. As a matter of fact, competition
should bring forth a fall in prices, but however, on the
contrary, such did not happen, the quotations reaching in the
years of 1909 and 1910 such extremes as had never been seen in
the rubber market. It will be sufficient to point out, that the
refined rubber of Pará, which is the Standard regulating type of
the market and whose average annual price has been 3, 4 and
even 5 shillings, went up in those years to 12s/6 per pound.</p>

<p>However, a new competitor did appear, which had to be taken
into consideration, and which induced the Government of
Brazil to adopt some measures tending to protect its great article
of export. The considerable and methodical plantations of the
<b>hevea brasiliensis</b> made in the peninsula of Malacca in Malasia
and on the island of Ceylon, commenced to produce rubber,
which it was predicted would within a few years, due to the
enormous quantity produced at a low figure, get the mastery of
the market.</p>

<p>These plantations, the initial experiments of which date from
the year of 1876, with 70,000 seeds sent from the Tapajóz
river, an affluent of the Amazon, by Wickham to the Royal Botanical
Garden of Kew, have taken an enormous increment
since the year 1896, till to-day, due to the results obtained
which indicated beyond possible doubt the advantages of the
cultivation of hevea, this in view of the constantly increasing
price of the product and the new applications which day after
day the rubber industry has opened up.</p>

<p>The cultivated-plantation rubber, which appeared on the market
with 5 tons in 1901, was represented by 646 tons five years
later and at the end of another equal period, by 12,000 tons.
It is estimated that if nothing unforeseen happens to the contrary,
its production in 1916 will be 70,000 tons, thus reaching
the quantity which is at the present moment consumed each
year by the necessities of the industry.</p>

<p>It is believed that by that time the inferior qualities furnished
by Africa, Central America and even by Brazil, will gradually
have disappeared from the market. In order to meet the consumption
which, if progression that hitherto has taken place,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
continues, will then be of 98,603 tons, the production of Brazil
and of the Orient together will surely render a quantity much superior
to that demand.</p>

<p>The average cost per Kilo of fine Pará rubber in the valley
of the Amazon is from 3$000 to 3$500; in India of 2$650; however,
this difference should disappear under the operation
of the Rubber Defence Act, which is inserted further on,
and the possible augmentation of the price in the Orient,
where manual labor will become dearer later on when all its
plantations are in full exploitation, and by the consequent scarcity
of labor, against which agriculturists are already commencing
to struggle.</p>

<p>The industrial element still continues to give preference to
the Brazilian rubber, this being better in quality, <b>nerve</b> and in
elasticity—properties these which may probably be attributed to
the process of curing, which is not employed in the Orient, or
possibly to the meteorologic and climate conditions, the geological
composition of the soil, etc. It is true that the quotation for
planted rubber has been superior to that of wild rubber, but it is
advisable not to forget, that while the former shrinks only 3 per
cent, and has a much better appearance, the latter loses 18 per
cent of its weight. The price difference is thus amply explained
and when accounts are made up it is still the fine quality from
Pará that is the better quoted.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h3 class="nobreak" id="THE_INDIA_RUBBER_PROBLEM">THE INDIA RUBBER PROBLEM—MEANS SUGGESTED AND RESOLVED BY THE STATES</h3>

</div>

<p>Threatened with losing the predominant position it has always
occupied in the rubber market of the world, Brazil could
not, without committing an economical suicide, remain inactive.</p>

<p>The time having come when native rubber would enter into
competition with planted rubber, Brazil had to defend its interests
by becoming equipped for the struggle, making the cost of its
product cheaper in order to ensure its occupying an advantageous
position in the market.</p>

<p>Many are the causes which at present contribute to the high
cost of Brazilian rubber, but they may be united into three
groups, as follows: 1st, expensive labour; 2nd, heavy transport
tariffs; and 3rd, excessive export taxes.</p>

<p>The expensive labour is due to the scantiness of population
in the Amazon valley, the want of foreign immigration to compensate
it, and the high cost of food supplies.</p>

<p>The rubber-producing trees (seringaes) of the Amazon are exploited<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
by the natives, whose number is but small, and by the
immigrants from the eastern States who, fleeing from the
droughts which periodically befall those States and attracted by
the liberal profits offered by the extraction of rubber, go there
in thousands every year. This current of immigration is, however,
insufficient; a proper remedy for such a state of things
would perhaps be foreign labour which still keeps back from the
North because it only knows it through garbled information.
The bad food and the indifference for all that concerns health
conditions, contribute every year to the invaliding of a considerable
number of men.</p>

<p>The extraction of India rubber being the occupation which
pays best in the Amazon Valley, the pastoral industry, cattle-breeding
and farming are altogether despised, so that all the articles
of subsistence needed by the population, either come from the
South of Brazil, burdened by cost of a long transport, or from
abroad overloaded with high Brazilian Customs duties.</p>

<p>The heavy transport tariffs are due to the numerous difficulties
of all sorts that thwart navigation in the affluents and sub-affluents
of the Amazon river and to the greediness of ship-owners,
encouraged by the absence of competition. On the other hand,
the existence of a complete river system has made the Brazilian
Governments disregard the necessity of establishing railways
which, by shortening distances, might bind the different affluents
of the great river to each other.</p>

<p>Finally, the excessive taxation imposed by the States of Amazonas
and Pará on its almost only product of exportation is a
consequence of the special conditions of life in that Brazilian region,
which conditions we have just described. The Governmental
and administrative system requires large sums for its maintenance,
is unable to avail itself of any other sources of income
because they hardly exist. The legislator has had to go on taxing
the great product more and more.</p>

<p>In order to cheapen the product, besides removing the causes
which have just been shown, two other far-reaching measures
have been suggested; the adoption of a process for coagulation
of the latex which might decrease the production of inferior rubbers,
and planting on a big scale.</p>

<p>At the present moment the exportation of rubber from the
Amazon is composed of 50 per cent of rubber “fina,” 10 per cent
of “entre-fina,” 25 per cent of “sernamby,” and 15 per cent of
“caucho.” Now, any process that can do away with or might
at least diminish the percentage of entrefina and sernamby would
be a means of cheapening the rubber of finer quality (fina). To
apply the same activity to produce 70 or 75 Kilos of “fina” instead
of 50 fina, 10 entrefina and 15 sernamby, is the same in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
reality as obtaining the first quality at a very much lower price.
Such is the desideratum of the process of Dr. Carlos de Cerqueira
Pinto, a Brazilian doctor who has lived for a great number
of years among the rubber districts where he has made
a most accurate study of the subject. The results hitherto attained
are very satisfactory, the Government of Brazil having
aided the inventor with a view to spreading his invention once
its advantages have been definitely proven.</p>

<p>At the same time, the process of extracting the rubber from
trees disseminated in the interior of the forests at a considerable
distance one tree from the other, is against all principles of economy.
The planting on a large scale, on the margin of the
Amazon river, or of its big affluents, but in places of easy
access, is an essential measure, especially seeing that the
Government aims at maintaining for Brazil in future, the prominent
position it now occupies in the trade. Therefore, whilst
considering all the complex elements of the question thoroughly,
a study had to be made of all the solutions presented. We shall
now see what procedure was followed:</p>

<p>In August, 1909, a Congress of seringueiros (rubber gatherers),
assembled in Acre with a view to studying and discussing
the situation of the rubber trade. In a message addressed
to the President of the Republic at the closing of the proceedings,
the members of the Congress suggested, as chief measures, easy
communications, roads, railway lines, subventioned lines of
steamers, colonization promoted by the Government and a reduction
in the export duty.</p>

<p>Later on, in the same year, the Pará Government enacted
Laws Nos. 1,100 and 1,109 of the 5th and 6th of November, both
of which have great bearing on the solution of this most important
problem.</p>

<p>The first of said laws gives authority, in article 1st, to the
State Government, to enter into agreements with one or more
native or foreign companies, in regard to the plantation and exploitation
of the seringueira (hevea brasiliensis) against the
concession of the following favors:</p>

<p>a. The concession of vacant lands up to twenty thousand
hectares with proper demarkations for the Company’s plantings.</p>

<p>b. Reduction in the export duty of planted rubber to the extent
of 50 per cent in the first 10 years as from the date of the
first exportation; of 40 per cent in the second decade; of 30 per
cent thenceforward until completion of twenty years.</p>

<p>c. Reduction of 30 per cent in the tariffs of the Bragança
railway and in the freights of the line of steamers subventioned
by the State, during a term of twenty years, for planted rubber
produced by the Company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>d. Transport free of charge by the Bragança railway and
steamers under the States’ subsidy of all machinery and plant
belonging to the Company and intended for the installation of
its establishments; and of whatever colonists the Company may
place in its premises as well as of seeds, manure plants and
cattle.</p>

<p>e. An advance, by way of guaranteed interest, of 5 per cent
per annum on the capital issued by the company holding the
concession to the extent of one-half of the paid up capital.</p>

<p>Special paragraph.—This guarantee, whatsoever be the Company’s
capital, shall not be paid on a sum exceeding £400,000
Sterling over and above £800,000 Sterling, or its equivalent in
paper money.</p>

<p>The advances, by way of guaranteed interest, thus conceded,
will be discontinued once the Company’s profits attain 6 per
cent, and on exceeding 7 per cent the Company will start amortizing
the sums loaned by the State to the extent of 5 per cent
on the total sum advanced.</p>

<p>The concession of lands available will be made by way of
emphyteusis for 99 years.</p>

<p>The Statutes will have to be approved by the Government,
who will name one of the Company’s Directors and retain certain
rights with a view to the due enforcement of the contract.</p>

<p>Article Second of the Law describes the Company’s obligations,
which are as follows:</p>

<p>First. To plant at least twenty thousand rubber trees per
year.</p>

<p>Second. To carry out instructions from the Agriculture Department
of the State in the planting.</p>

<p>Third. To maintain a rural elementary school, with accommodation
for the shelter of at least twenty destitute children,
and a field of practical tuition of mechanical agriculture, experimental
cultivation of tropical plants, experiments in manure, etc.</p>

<p>Fourth. Accessory planting of rice, maize, haricot beans,
etc., improving the quality of same by mechanical means.</p>

<p>Fifth. Furnish accurate yearly statistics of the number of
plantations made, their state and the general production of rubber
and other articles.</p>

<p>Sixth. Use on the bags, boxes and other receptacles containing
the goods produced, a trade-mark duly registered at the
Board of Trade as prescribed by law.</p>

<p>Seventh. Allow the Government to control all the work
carried out by the Company in such manner as the Government
may think fit.</p>

<p>Complementary to the former, the Law of November 6th
concedes prizes and other favors to the agriculturists of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
State, who, by themselves or associations formed by them, should
fulfil the conditions set forth in same.</p>

<p>The prizes are of five hundred mil réis for each plot of five
hundred rubber trees properly planted; the favors consist of
the distribution free of charge of chemical manure, seeds, plants,
instructions and agricultural monographs, gratuitous tuition to
all the laborer-planters, transport free by the Bragança Railway
and steamers subsidized by the State, reduction of export duties,
<b>etc.</b></p>

<p>Lastly, Law No. 1,115, of the 8th November, 1909, affords
protection to the rubber trees that are actually yielding, with a
view to improving their production.</p>

<p>Article First authorizes the Government of the State to further
the defence of the rubber industry as regards the latex and
preparation of rubber, in order to prevent the destruction of the
trees existing in the State, punishment being dealt to whomsoever
manufactures the product by subversive means.</p>

<p>Article second provides a prize of 50 contos of réis paper
money at most, to be awarded at the Government’s discretion,
to the discoverer or inventor of some process of manufacturing
or preparing rubber, which may afford undeniable advantages as
regards its manufacture and reduces the inferior classes to a
single standard of rubber “fina,” ensuring a high price for the
article.</p>

<p>The State of Amazonas also, as per Law No. 675 of May 20,
1911, authorizes the Executive Power to concede any advisable
favors to individuals or undertakings that may bind themselves
to put up in Manáos factories for refinement of rubber by means
of new and improved methods, so as to obtain a standard class
of rubber for exportation.</p>

<p>The Commercial, Industrial and Agricultural Congress held
at Manáos in February, 1910, resolved in its final conclusions
to recommend to the Brazilian Government and the immediate
neighboring Republics, the reforming of their freights, especially
as regards the food supplies; grant favors to navigation; free
rivers from obstructions; construct railways; create colonial
centres; admit of the pressing and absolute necessity to plant
rubber trees in the Amazon valley and open new fields of plantation;
suggests the establishment of permanent exhibitions of a
highly educational character; advises the rubber extractors not
to give up the process of curing by smoke and condemns entirely
the use of acids or alum in the coagulation, and calls attention to
the question of the commercial classes of rubber which should
be properly defined. Going into details it requests numerous
favors for the agriculturists that may go in for planting hevea
rubber trees, cacao and cereals, cotton and other products, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
that prizes be granted to cattle breeders, experimental fields be
opened, as also laboratories of analysis and a service be established
for dealing with the yellow fever and paludinous fevers, etc.</p>

<p>Such an important matter could not be solved by half-measures;
it was necessary and even indispensable to adopt a
plan embracing all the solutions suggested and proclaimed as
being elements of success, thus obtaining a united plan entailing
some complexity in its execution, it is true, yet clear and simple
in its combined purposes.</p>

<p>And this desideratum was achieved by the Federal Law No.
2,543 A of the fifth of January, 1912.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="MEASURES_ADOPTED_BY_THE_FEDERAL_GOVERNMENT">MEASURES ADOPTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT—RIO DE JANEIRO CONGRESS OF
RUBBER—REGULATIONS OF THE NEW RUBBER DEFENSE ACT</h3>

</div>

<p>For a long time back the attention of the Brazilian Government
has been drawn to the necessity of adopting a plan of defence
for India rubber, which might solve in a practical and
decisive manner the so-long-debated “problem of the North.”</p>

<p>In August, 1911, the Minister of Agriculture, after a close
study, made with the aid of specialists and persons having
full knowledge of that region of the country, drew up a project
in the above sense and, recognizing the necessity of still hearing
those who are most directly interested in the matter, convened a
meeting of representatives of the State Governments, Commercial
Associations and other Institutions which might lead to
a perfect understanding of what was most advisable to do.</p>

<p>The first meeting was held on August 14, and the Government’s
plan was hailed with great applause, the same being
approved, with slight alterations, in the last session which took
place on the twenty-second of the same month.</p>

<p>By Message of September 14, 1911, Marshal Hermes da
Fonseca, President of the Republic, sent to the National Congress
for approval, the plan duly elaborated; after being carefully
studied by Congress it was approved and converted into
Law, under No. 2,543 A and was sanctioned on January 5, 1912.</p>

<p>On April 17, 1912, Decree No. 9,521 was enacted with the
Regulation for carrying out the measures and services provided
for in the law of January.</p>

<p>The measures and services prescribed by Law No. 2,543 A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
of January, 1912, for the economic defence of rubber, regulated
by Decree No. 9,521 of April 17, 1912, are as follows:</p>

<p>I. To encourage the rubber extractor and the cultivator of
the principal rubber-producing trees.</p>

<p>II. To form industries for the refinement and manufacture
of rubber articles.</p>

<p>III. To aid immigrants, both from the country and those
who have recently arrived from abroad, and the workmen
already established in the Amazon valley.</p>

<p>IV. To render transport easy and decrease the cost in the
Amazon valley.</p>

<p>V. To install productive centres of food supplies in the
Amazon valley.</p>

<p>VI. To hold three-yearly exhibitions in Rio de Janeiro, comprehending
all that relates to the rubber industry of the country.</p>

<p>The measures contained in the law in regard to making agreements
with the States which produce rubber “seringa,” with a
view to decreasing the export duties and protecting the rubber
trade, will be dealt with separately, and with regard to the definition
and legalization of freeholds in the Federal Territory in
Acre and the revision and consolidation of regulations concerning
the coasting service of steamers (included in No. IV) special
By-Laws will be drawn up which shall be published in due
course.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The measures in reference to the first group and whose object
is to encourage the extracting industry and plantation of the
principal rubber producing trees are: First, reduction of the
cost of tools and materials employed in the rubber trade; second,
granting of prizes in money to the planters of the principal rubber
trees; third, installation of experimental stations for the cultivation
of rubber.</p>

<p>For the reduction in the cost of utensils and materials, free
entrance is granted with exemption from any import duties, as
well as to everything intended for the cultivation of the
seringueira, caucho, maniçoba and mangabeira and the gathering-in
and improving of rubber extracted from those trees;
whether as regards the extracting industry or the plantation
work.</p>

<p>These pecuniary premiums for encouraging the industry, will
be conceded to all those who plant entirely anew, or who devote
themselves to replanting; in the first case and for every group
of 12 hectares, the premiums will be Rs. 2:500$000 when the
planting is of “seringueira”; Rs. 1:500$000 when it treats of
“caucho” or “maniçoba”; and 900$000 when it is mangabeira; in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
the second case and for every group of 25 hectares the premiums
will be 2:000$000, 1:000$000 and 720$000 respectively. The
minimum number of trees for the new plantations will be 250
per hectare for the seringueira and caucho, and 400 for the maniçoba
and mangabeira; in the case of re-planting, the distance to
keep between the trees should be from 6 metres to 6m50 for
the first mentioned case and 5 metres for the second. In order
to obtain the payment of the premium, it is requisite that the
trees be well cared for, and that not more than 15 per cent are
damaged or useless.</p>

<p>The subsidiary cultivation of alimentitious plants or of those
useful for industrial purposes, will secure an annual gratuity
corresponding to 5 per cent of the value of the principal
premium.</p>

<p>For the cultivation of the seringueira, experimental stations
will be localized in the Territory of the Acre, and in the States
of Matto Grosso, Amazonas, Pará, Maranhão, Piauhy and Bahia
and for the growing of the maniçoba conjointly with that of the
mangabeira in the States of Piauhy, Ceará, Pernambuco, Bahia,
Minas Geraes, S. Paulo, Goyaz, Paraná and Matto Grosso.</p>

<p>Each station will have an area of from 80 to 100 hectares, the
land selected having to be suited to the climatic and agrological
conditions exacted by the nature or quality of the plant to
be cultivated.</p>

<p>Besides the grounds for experimental cultivation, each
station will possess laboratories of vegetable physiology for the
testing of seeds and phytopathology, of agricultural entomology;
of agricultural vegetable chemistry and bromotology and of
microbiology and technology; an agricultural and woodlands
museum; a gallery of machines and a meteorological post.
Thus it will be properly equipped in order to serve those
who may consult it upon any matter whatsoever, within
the scope of its competency, carry out the analysis of manures
and other chemical fertilizers, plants and waters, distribute
plants and selected seeds, study the diseases common to
growing plants and the means of combatting them, making commonly
known by means of the publication of an official bulletin
which will be distributed gratuitously to all interested parties,
the results obtained relative to the most practical and economical
means of carrying out the cultivation of rubber, the best means
of bettering its condition, its preservation, the packing of the
products, etc.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>In order to stimulate the creation in Brazil of the industries
for refining and manufacturing all kinds of articles made of
rubber, monetary premiums will be instituted as well as exemption<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
from taxes, the right of disappropriation for private individuals,
that may be necessary for the installation and mounting
of factories and the preference of the Government will be
granted for such articles, which each factory produces, when
supplies are made to the army and to the navy, as well as to
other public departments.</p>

<p>The premiums will be as high as 400:000$000 for the first
factory for the refining of seringa rubber that may be established
in each of the cities of Belém and Manáos; up to 100:000$000 for
the first rubber-refining factory of “maniçoba” and of mangabeira,
which may be installed in each one of the States of Piauhy,
Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Pernambuco, Bahia, Minas Geraes
and São Paulo; and finally of 500:000$000 for the first factory of
rubber-made articles, which is inaugurated in Manáos, Belém,
Recife, Bahia and Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>The exemption from import duties embraces the rights of
importation for the materials, machinery, utensils and the necessary
tools for the construction and mounting of the factory and
the chemical substances, textile articles and divers materials,
combustibles and lubricants indispensable for the up-keep and
working of the factory during the time-term of 25 years; and
immunity from the State and Municipal taxes for the time term
of the contract by reason of the factory being considered a
Federal Service.</p>

<p>The premium in cash shall only be considered when the
capital of the factory is equivalent to 4 times its value. The
payment of such premium will be effected immediately after the
inauguration of the factory.</p>

<p>The problem of assisting immigrants both national and
foreign, who may have just arrived and the laborers established
in the valley of the Amazon, is met by the installation of emigrant-hotels
in Belém, in Manáos and in the Territory of the
Acre, by the construction of hospitals in the Interior and by the
creation of agricultural colonies adjacent to such hospitals.</p>

<p>The hotels for the reception of immigrants shall follow the
rule and be guided in their installation by that of the Ilha das
Flores in Rio de Janeiro, that latter being considered a Model
Institution, at the same time the modifications exacted by the
conditions of each particular case, that of Belém having sufficient
capacity to accommodate 1,500 immigrants; that of Manáos
1,200 and that of Acre 800. Close to each of these immigrant-quarters,
a store-house will be erected which shall contain all
kinds of special tools and utensils employed in the India rubber
industry, the which will be sold to the immigrants, who desire
to buy them at strictly cost price.</p>

<p>The families of both national and foreign immigrants who do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
not expressly declare that they prefer another destination will
be sent to the National Fazendas (ranches) of the Rio Branco,
where they will be located and distributed among the different
colonial centres in the different colonies.</p>

<p>The hospitals in the Interior are created with a view of providing
the inhabitants of the Amazon valley with a centre to
which they may have recourse and where they may be treated,
acquire medicine and protect themselves against contagious diseases.
The points selected for these are Boa Vista of the Rio
Branco, S. Gabriel on the Rio Negro, Teffé or Fonte Boa on the
river Solimões, São Felippe on the river Juruá, Bocca do Acre on
the Rio Purús, at the confluence of the river Arinos with the
Juruéna, in the Alto Tapajóz, Conceição of the river Araguaya,
and Montenegro on the Amapá.</p>

<p>Each hospital will have accommodation for 100 sick people
and will be divided into 5 pavillions, one of these latter being
constructed with all the requisites necessary for the isolation of
infectious diseases; there will also be a disinfecting house, a
laboratory for chemical and microbiologic diagnosis, rooms for
surgical operations and for autopsies, consulting rooms and
pharmacy.</p>

<p>There will also be a service of propaganda of the habits and
hygienic measures necessary for the laborers who work and live
in the Amazonian valley.</p>

<p>Adjoining each hospital, agricultural centres will be founded
wherein to localize 100 families at the least, these agricultural
centres will have for their object the production of the
alimenticiary products necessary for the supply of the said
hospitals, the cultivation and extensive breeding of the plants
and animals consumed as food by the neighboring population
located all around, and the constitution of fixed centres of population
which shall help towards the increased peopling of the
region. The Government will assist the emigrants in the
acquiring of lands and shall furnish them with food stuffs at a
low price and their maintenance during the initial period.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Amongst the improvements and means tending to facilitate
transport and diminish its cost in the valley of the Amazon, the
construction of systems of railways and the betterment of the
navigability of the rivers most peopled, is of great importance.</p>

<p>The network of iron roads will be of two different categories:
systems of great lines forming an integral part of the general
Federal system of railroads and a network of economic narrow-gauged
railways having the character simply of penetration lines.</p>

<p>Belonging to the first of these categories the following networks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
will be commenced at once, and constructed within the
shortest space of time possible: 1º starting from Belém de Pará
and joining onto the general railway system in Pirapóra, Minas
Geraes and in Coroatá, in Maranhão, with the necessary branches
to connect the initial or terminal point of navigation on the
rivers Araguaya, Tocantins, Parahyba and S. Francisco; 2º
starting point from the Madeira e Mamoré Railway in the
proximity of the mouth of the Abunã, passing by the town of
Rio Branco and by the most appropriate point between Senna
Madueira and Catay and terminating in the town of Thaumaturgo,
with branch line right up to the frontier of Perú, along the
valley of the river Purús.</p>

<p>The construction and renting out of these railways will be
done in competition by Public Tender.</p>

<p>The concession for the railways of the second category shall
only be made to those who undertake to colonize and exploit
in proportion as that may be justified, the respective
marginal lands, i.e., the land lying along each side of such said
lines. The Government will concede a subsidy of 25:000$000
per kilometre constructed; the technical conditions are: a line of
the Decauville portatil, the weight of the rails being 50 kilos per
metre, with a gauge of 0.60 between the rails and the minimum
radius of the curve 40 meters inclination 0.10 and weight of the
locomotives in full working order, 18 to 20 tons.</p>

<p>By way of experiment the Governments will bring about at
once, the construction of 2 economic railway systems, 1º starting
from Antiga Sauzel on the left bank of the river Xingú and going
up the valley as far as the river Careahy, with a branch leading
to the river Tapajóz, whose valley it will follow until the river
S. Manoel and with other sub-branches; 2º starting from the confluent
of the Rio Negro with the Rio Branco and following the
valleys of Seruiny and the Caratimani passing over the water-shed
and going on until it terminates in the Alto Uraricoera,
with 2 branches, the one for the Alto Paduary and the other for
the town of Boa Vista.</p>

<p>The necessary improvements to be made towards effecting
the navigability of the rivers at all seasons of the year, by
steamers drawing up to 3 feet of water, of the Rio Negro, between
S. Isabel and Cucuhy, on the Rio Branco from its mouth
as far as S. Joaquim; of the river Purús between Hiutanahã and
Senna Madureira, and of the river Acre from its mouth as far
as Riosinho de Pedras, will be contracted for by public-tender
or by some public company which can prove itself sufficiently
capable for the carrying out of the same. The maximum time-term
for the termination of the improvements will be 7 years.</p>

<p>As supplementary measures, the exemption from taxes is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
conceded to the floating material of whatever kind destined to
fluvial navigation in the valley of the Amazon and floating
depots for the supply of coal and oil-fuel will be established
at different points of the river Amazon, its affluents and sub-affluents.</p>

<p>The establishment of these depots and the business of supplying
the combustibles will be done by signed contract, with
the Minister of Agriculture, after the competition by public-tender,
the concessioner enjoys besides other favors, exemption
from import-duties for the floating material and for the combustible
material imported as also full exemption from all State
and Municipal taxes by reason of the object of his contract being
considered a federal public service.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The creation of centres for producing food-stuffs in the valley
of the Amazon being held as an element of the greatest urgency
towards the successful issue of the plan elaborated, is assured
by the following series of administrative measures: 1º, the renting
out of the 2 national ranches on the Rio Branco, that of S.
Bento and that of S. Marcus, to a public Company or undertaking
which agrees to open up, and practice cattle-breeding
of different kinds on a large scale and the cultivation of cereals
commonly used as aliments, the establishment of a curing establishment
for preparing dry meat, known as xarque, and a factory
of alimenticiary conserved goods, a dairy establishment, a rice-mill
and 2 mandioca grinding-mills. The company in question
will take charge of and localize the emigrants who desire to
be placed upon the lands belonging to the said ranches in accordance
with the Federal laws regulating such matters.</p>

<p>The favors of exemption from duties for the imported material
necessary to the mounting of the fazenda or ranch and the installation
of the mills and factories will be conceded, as also
for the stud-cattle and seeds imported and for the chemical
manures and all materials necessary for the factories and for
the cultivation during the whole of the time of the contract.
They shall also enjoy the right to disappropriate for public
utility and shall have preference for the contract to carry out
the necessary works and improvements in the navigation of the
Rio Branco.</p>

<p>The colonization of the lands of the “fazenda” of São Marcus
situated between the rivers Mahú, Takutú, Surumú and Cotingo
on the frontier of British Guyana, will be made directly by the
Ministry of Agriculture. 2º Premiums and favors will be conceded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
to whomsoever may found great ranches for cattle
breeding and for great agricultural purposes in territory of the
Acre (between Rio Branco and Xapury), in the State of Amazonas
(in the region of the Autaz), in the State of Pará (in
the Island of Marajó), or in other more convenient points of the
lower Amazon.</p>

<p>These premiums are of 30:000$000 per group of 1,000 hectares
of artificial pastures, planted and fenced round, of 100:000$000
per group of 1,000 hectares of lands effectively cultivated with
rice, black haricot beans, Indian-corn and mandioca, and 100:000$000
per group of 500 tons of manufactured goods, of dairy
produce and of preserved meat and xarque, which may have been
produced within a time-space of 5 years.</p>

<p>The favors are those of exemption from import duties for
everything whatsoever that may be necessary to the proper installation
and maintenance of the fazenda or ranch during
5 years. 3º Concession of favors to a fishing company or undertaking,
that shall be established either in Belém or in Manáos,
for exercising that industry and all subsidiary industries connected
therewith on a large scale on the rivers of Amazonia.
The favors consist of the entry free from import duties for all
the material belonging to the company as also for all the fittings
of steamers and other floating material and factories that may
be necessary during the first 15 years, encouragement premiums
of 10:000$000 during 5 consecutive years in the event of the production
of fish either preserved or salted being maintained at
a figure above 100 tons; the right of disappropriation for public
utility of the lands or buildings that may be necessary for the
undertaking, the exemption from state and municipal taxes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Recognizing the utility of periodical expositions which are
held as centres of special studies, producing practical results by
the sum of knowledge which may be derived from them, 3 yearly
expositions shall be held in Rio de Janeiro, which shall embrace
all and everything which has relation to the rubber-industry.</p>

JANEIRO IN THE MONTH OF MAY, 1913</h3>

</div>

<p>The Superintendence Department of the Rubber-Defence, a
provisional Department of the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry
and Commerce on which is incumbent the direction and fiscalizing
of all the services comprised under the Law No. 2543 of the
fifth of January of 1912, has already initiated its works, undertaking
the execution of the following measures.</p>

<p>1. Resolution to hold a National Rubber Exhibition in Rio
de Janeiro, opening on the thirteenth of May of 1913.</p>

<p>2. Installation of experimental stations, 7 centres for the
cultivation of the seringueira (Acre, Amazonas, Pará, Maranhão,
Piauhy, Bahia and Matto Grosso), and 6 for the cultivation of
maniçoba and mangabeira (Piauhy, Ceará, Pernambuco, Bahia,

<p>The rubber exposition which is to take place in Rio de
Janeiro, 1 every 3 years, will have for its object to show the
triennial balance of rubber in its various modalities, comparing
it with the situation of the same industry in other countries.</p>

<p>The first exhibition will be inaugurated on the thirteenth of
May of the coming year and will be divided into four sections;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
1º The cultivation; 2º extraction; 3º improvement; 4º manufacture
of articles.</p>

<p>The sections will be divided into groups and classes comprising
the native or cultivated plants, machinery, utensils,
processes, commercial types, studies and statistics.</p>

<p>Encouragement premiums will be conferred for the best processes
of cultivation, extraction and preparing and for the
objects best manufactured, whether of raw material constituting
trade types for exportation or as manufactured articles.</p>

<p>The sale of machinery, utensils and rubber articles and products
of all kinds will be provided for against payment of a small
percentage, fixed by the organizing commission.</p>

<p>Foreign products may be admitted to the exhibition, but
without having the right to a premium. They will enjoy full
custom-house freedom from import-duty, but should they be
sold they shall pay the respective import-duty on the occasion
of their being handed over to the buyers. The re-exportation of
the products not sold will run for account of the exhibitor.</p>

<p>Lectures upon the rubber-industry will be given during the
Exhibition-Congress.</p>

<p>The Commission which will carry out the Exposition of the
thirteenth of May, is constituted by their Excellencies Senhores
Drs. Pedro de Toledo, Minister of Agriculture, Industry and
Commerce, Raymondo Pereira da Silva, Superintendent of the
Rubber-Defence Department, Miguel Calmon du Pin e Almeida,
Representative of the National Agricultural Society, Jorge
Street, President of the Centro Industrial of Brazil, Julho
Furtado, Inspector of Forests, Gardens, Tree-planting, Hunting
and Fishing of the Federal District, Representative of the
Municipal Prefecture and Candido Mendes de Almeida, Director
of the Commercial Museum of Rio de Janeiro, Secretary General.</p>

<p>The site chosen for the exposition is in the Quinta de Boa
Vista, perhaps the most beautiful park of Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>The preparatory works, such as the ground-leveling, laying-out
of gardens, adoption of pavillions already existing, etc.,
is now already in full course of being carried out.</p>

<p>The opportuneness of this event, the interest evinced in it
by the South and North and the United forces of the Institutions
that form the organizing commission, will secure a very
considerable number of exhibitors.</p>

<p>The month of May, one of the pleasantest months as regards
temperature in Rio de Janeiro, is the season chosen by those
who desire to visit the beautiful capital and thus the gathering
of visitors to the exhibition will certainly be notable.</p>

<p>Thus appears certain the most brilliant success for the Rubber
Exhibition of Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p class="center">Decree No. 2542A of January 5, 1912</p>

</div>

<p>Establishing measures destined to facilitate and develop the
culture of rubber, Caucho, Maniçoba and Mangabeira, and the
gathering and treatment of the rubber extracted from these trees,
and authorizing the executive power not only to open the credits
necessary to carry out these measures, but also to contract such
loans as may be necessary for that purpose.</p>

<p>The President of the Republic of the United States of Brazil:</p>

<p>Hereby makes known that the National Congress decreed
and I hereby sanction the following resolution:</p>

<p>Art. 1.—All utensils and materials destined for the culture
of rubber (seringueira), Caucho, Maniçoba and Mangabeira
and for the collecting or treatment of rubber extracted from these
trees, whether for the purpose of extracting or experimenting,
shall be admitted free of all custom house duties, including fees.</p>

<p>Only Section.—This exemption will have to be requisitioned
of the inspectors at custom houses, who will grant it without
delay after verifying the right of those seeking this favor.</p>

<p>Art. 2.—Premiums will be granted to those who start regular
and entirely new plantations of Seringueira, Caucho, Maniçoba or
Mangabeira, or replant old forests of Seringueira, Caucho, Maniçoba
or Mangabeira, as soon as the plantation has taken place,
and will be paid on the following conditions:</p>

<p>(a) For groups of 12 hectares (about 30 acres) of new culture,
2,500 milreis if seringueira; 1,500 milreis if caucho or maniçoba;
900 milreis if mangabeira.</p>

<p>(b) For groups of 25 hectares, the replanting of native seringueira,
caucho, maniçoba or mangabeira, 2,000 milreis; for the
first, 1,000 milreis; for the second and third, and 720 milreis for
the fourth kind.</p>

<p>Section 1. These premiums will be payable one year before
the first gathering, when it is shown that the ground is entirely
cultivated and the trees well cared for.</p>

<p>Sec. 2. An increase of 5 per cent will be given annually in
addition to the premium offered planters of seringa rubber (to
count from the beginning of the planting), who prove that they
have cultivated between the rows in all the ground planted,
plants of alimentation or of industrial use.</p>

<p>Art. 3. The Government will establish, at a selected convenient
point, an experimental station, or field for demonstrating<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
the culture of seringueira in the Territory of Acre, in each of the
States of Matto Grosso, Amazonas, Pará, Maranhão, Piauhy and
Bahia, and for the culture of maniçoba jointly with mangabeira,
in each of the States of Piauhy, Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte,
or Pernambuco, Bahia, Minas Geraes, São Paulo, Goyaz, Paraná
and Matto Grosso.</p>

<p>These stations will furnish gratuitously, selected seed to all
those interested, also instructions as to the most practical and
economic methods of culture and will supply information concerning
general results, which will be verified at the end of each
year.</p>

<p>Art. 4.—In addition to the indirect favors which are mentioned
in Art. 1 and others which may seem reasonable and necessary,
the Government will grant the right of premiums of encouragement,
up to the sum of 400,000 milreis to the first plant
established for refining the seringa rubber, that reduces the different
qualities to a uniform type and superior to that exported
and which may be established in each of the cities of Belém
(Pará), and Manáos; up to 100,000 milreis to the first refining
plant of maniçoba and mangabeira rubber, that accomplishes
the same purpose and is established in each of the States of
Piauhy, Ceará, Rio Grande do Norte, Pernambuco, Bahia, Minas
Geraes and São Paulo; and up to 500,000 milreis to the first factory
of rubber articles which shall be established in Manáos,
Belém (Pará), Recife (Pernambuco), Bahia and Rio de Janeiro.</p>

<p>Only Section.—In order to have the right to the benefit of
the above article it is necessary for the factory to have actually
employed a capital four times as great as the value of the
premium.</p>

<p>Art. 5.—The Government will put up three buildings to house
immigrants, to be of sufficient capacity and internally arranged,
the same as those on Flores Island. In Belém, Manáos, at an
appropriate place in the Territory of Acre, and also at places in
the Valley of the Amazon, where they are considered to be the
most necessary, hospitals are to be erected, surrounded by small
agricultural colonies where the sick can be received for treatment,
be vaccinated gratuitously, and where medicines of the first
quality are kept for sale, especially sulphate of quinine. Pamphlets
containing suggestions about hygiene, prevention of the
diseases of that region and the practical remedies to use in the
absence of a physician, will be distributed freely.</p>

<p>The superintendence of these stations will be maintained by
the Federal Government, but the hospitals will be entrusted to
professionals of recognized ability, under a subvention or other
favors, which the Government considers reasonable and rules
will be enforced which will secure their proper regulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>Art. 6.—For the purpose of facilitating transportation and
reducing its cost in the valley of the Amazon, the Government
will cause to be made, as soon as possible, the following improvements:</p>

<p>1. The construction by the Government of narrow gauge
railroads along the Rivers Xingú, Tapajos and others in Pará,
Matto Grosso, and of the Rio Negro and Rio Branco and others
in Amazonas, through the valleys through which they flow, in
accordance with the authorization of Congress, Law No. 1,126,
December 13, 1903, at the price fixed per kilometer, according
to the difficulties of the region, at the discretion of the Government.</p>

<p>In case the State of Pará and Amazonas should contract for
the construction of some of these railroads, the Federal Government
for the more rapid completion of the work will concede
an increase of 15 contos per kilometer.</p>

<p>2. The construction of a railroad, which, parting at a convenient
point of the Madeira-Mamoré Railroad, near the mouth of
the River Abunã, passes by the village Rio Branco, and at a
point between Senna Madureira and Caty, and terminates in the
village Thaumaturgo, with a branch to the frontier of Perú, by
the valley of the Purús River.</p>

<p>The construction of this road shall be in accordance with
the provisions of Law No. 1,126, of December 13, 1903. As
soon as the first section of the trunk line is inaugurated to the
village of Rio Branco, the Government will install a custom house
at Porto Velho on the Madeira River and announce this port
open to commerce with friendly nations.</p>

<p>3. Construction of a railroad starting at the port of Belém of
Pará and joining the net work of railroads of Central Brazil at
Pirapóra, in the State of Minas Geraes, and of Northern Brazil
at Coroatá, in the State of Maranhão, with the necessary branch
lines to join the initial points or terminals of navigation on the
Rivers Araguaya, Tocantins, Parahyba and S. Francisco. The
railroad shall be built according to the provisions of Law No.
1,126, December 13, 1903, and shall be leased by public competition.</p>

<p>4. The execution of the works necessary for the effective
navigation, at any season of the year, of steamers drawing three
feet of water; on the Rio Negro, between Santa Isabel and
Cucuhy; on the Rio Branco, from its mouth to Fort S. Joaquim;
on the River Purús, from Hyutanahan to Senna Madureira; on
the River Acre from its mouth to Riosinho das Pedras.</p>

<p>The Government may contract for the execution of these
works by public competition, or independent of competition, with
one or more individuals or firms offering sufficient guaranty,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
applying the provisions established by the decree, No. 6,368, February
14, 1907, or others, which will not impose greater burdens,
and which may be more economic.</p>

<p>Art. 7.—For the same purpose as mentioned in the previous
article, all vessels of any kind destined for river navigation, are
declared exempt from all custom house duties, including fees,
revision, rates.</p>

<p>Art. 8.—The Government will grant the same exemption in
addition to the indirect favors found convenient, to the contractor
who will bind himself at a public competition, to establish coal
depots at points in the valley of the Amazon previously indicated,
and to supply steamers and launches with fuel at prices approved
by the Government.</p>

<p>Art. 9.—The Government will promote and aid the production
of food stuffs in the valley of the Amazon through the following
measures, or others which may be found convenient and promise
satisfactory results.</p>

<p>1. The leasing of two of the National Reservations on the Rio
Branco, at a public auction or private competition to a reliable
concern, which binds itself to develop on a large scale, the breeding
of cattle of improved types, the production of cereals, and
other foodstuffs, to establish packing houses, dairies, rice-shelling
mills, flour and mandiok mills, etc.</p>

<p>2. Direct colonization, through the Federal Government, on
lands still belonging to the Union, on the S. Marcos Reservation,
situated between the Rivers Mahú, Takutú, Surumú and Cotingo,
with native families of farmers and stock-farmers, with a view
of developing and increasing the production of foodstuffs, as well
as horses and mules.</p>

<p>3. Concession to concerns which propose to establish large
plantations or colonies under the above mentioned conditions,
one in the Territory of Acre (between the Rio Branco and Xapury),
one in the State of Amazonas (in the region of the Autaz
River), and one in the State of Pará (on the island of Marajó
or other point more convenient on the lower Amazon), granting
them the following favors:</p>

<p>(a) Exemption from all import duties, including fees, for all
material imported, necessary for establishing the plantation, including
buildings, corrals, pastures, fences, watering places, agricultural
implements and machines for the cultivation, harvesting

and decrease its cost in the valley of the Amazon</span></h3>

</div>

<h4>CHAPTER I<br>
<span class="smaller">Lines of railroad transportation</span></h4>

<p>Art. 45. There shall be constructed in the valley of the
Amazon lines of railroad transportation of two classes:</p>

<p>1. Large lines of transportation, making an integral part
of the general line of Federal railroads, with identical characteristics
and comprising the same principles.</p>

<p>2. Economic lines of transportation, of reduced gauge, provisionally
established for easy ways of penetration, whatever
may be their development, sufficient to facilitate access to and
permit the exploration of the virgin seringas and the good lands
for cultivation situated on the upper banks of the Rivers Xingú,
Tapajóz, Branco, Negro, and others situated in the States of
Pará, Matto-Grosso and Amazonas.</p>

<p>Art. 46. Those lines belonging to the first class shall be
immediately begun and constructed as quickly as possible, the
following:</p>

<p>1. Parting from the Port of Belém (Pará) and joining the
general line of railroad in Pirapóra, in the State of Minas
Geraes and in Coroatá, in the State of Maranhão, with the
necessary branches to unite the initial points or terminals of
navigation on the Rivers Arguaya, Tocantins, Parnaluyba, and
S. Francisco.</p>

<p>2. Beginning at a convenient point chosen on the Madeira-Mamoré
railroad, near the mouth of the River Abunã, passing
by the Villa Rio Branco, and the point most appropriate between
Senna Medureira and Catay and terminating in Villa
Thaumaturgo, with a branch to the frontier of Perú by the
valley of the River Purús.</p>

<p>Art. 47. The rules for the construction of these lines is
prescribed by law, number 1,126, Dec. 15, 1903, and both shall
be let at public bidding.</p>

<p>Art. 48. The Minister of Transportation is to command the
studies to be made, to contract for the construction and inspect
the traffic of these roads, but he will furnish the Minister
of Agriculture a copy of the plans relative to the route and give
descriptive memoranda of the project, and when drawing up the
papers for the bidding, shall include the clauses which he shall
judge necessary and opportune for the colonization of the bordering
lands and the development of the industries of the zone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
tributary to the line as well as to attend to the eventual necessities
of the commerce.</p>

<p>Art. 49. The construction and the concession for construction
of the roads of the second class may be made by the Union
or by the States interested.</p>

<p>Art. 50. The Minister of Agriculture is the proper person
to construct or permit the construction of those Government
resolves to carry into effect at the account of the Union, as well
as to authorize the payment of the subvention of 15,000 mibreis
per kilometer to those which were contracted for by the States.</p>

40 M. O.</p>

<p>Greatest incline OmO10.</p>

<p>Weight of locomotives 18 to 20 tons.</p>

<p>Art. 52. The concessions for these roads shall be let at a
public bidding according to the rule established in law number
1,126 of 1903, or independently of bidding with a person or corporation
sufficiently able with the help of the payment of the
maximum subvention of 25 contos per kilometer, according to
the difficulties of the land it passes through, paid by sections of
not less than 30 kilometers, completely ready and furnished with
the necessary rolling stock, within 90 days of the date of the
respective inaugurations.</p>

<p>Art. 53. The concession for these railroads cannot be given
to those who agree to build then simply as transportation enterprises,
but only to those who will obligate themselves to
colonize and explore, in proportion as they may be justified, the
respective marginal lands.</p>

<p>It is an essential condition for the validity of the concession,
that the contractor presents to the Minister of Agriculture
within the maximum term of one year, proof that he has disposed
of the lands for colonization, and a descriptive memorandum
of the character and extent of the industries he intends
to develop.</p>

<p>Art. 54. Those railroads of this type which in the future
may be joined to any general line of transportation, shall be
obliged as soon as its gross earnings amount to 10,000 mibreis
per kilometer, to make its gauge conform to the same, and from
then for all purposes becoming a part of the general federal
transportation system.</p>

<p>Independently of being joined to any railroad in general,
these economical railroads shall pass to the jurisdiction of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
Minister of Transportation and Public Works and shall be
obliged to enlarge their gauge to 1 meter, without other favors
from the Government, there not being a supplementary term
of the contract, if it is wanting for its termination in less than
60 years, when the gross receipts have reached 15,000 mibreis
per kilometer during 3 successive years. Before this the railroad
may pass to the Minister of Transportation and the gauge
be widened, on his own account, when he shall think it to his
interest, or by a new contract, when the Government thinks it
necessary to have it done for the necessities of the administration
or the defense of the country.</p>

<p>Art. 55. In addition to the subvention per kilometer, there
shall be given to these railroads all the indirect favors received
by the other railroads of the country.</p>

<p>Art. 56. The maximum term for a concession shall be 90
years, at the end of which the railroad will revert to the control
of the Union.</p>

<p>Art. 57. Under the right of experiment, the Government
shall promote at once the following lines of economical railroads:</p>

<p>1. Parting from “Antiga Souzel,” or other point more convenient
on the left bank of the Xingú and ascending the left
side of the valley to the margin of the River Cariahy, with a
branch which parting at a convenient point, shall go to the
Tapajóz and ascend the right hand side of the valley until it
reaches the S. Manoel which may appear advantageous, ascending
the secondary valley and continuing to the dividing of the
waters of the two principal rivers.</p>

<p>2. Parting from the confluence of the River Negro with the
Branco and by the valley of the River Seruiny, gaining the right
side of the valley by the Caratimani river and continuing to the
upper Uraricoera, with a branch parting at a convenient point
at the request of the upper Paduiry and a branch in the direction
of the Villa Boa Vista.</p>

the River Negro, between Santa Izabel and Cucuhy, on the
River Branco, from its mouth to São Joaquin, on the River
Purús, between Hyutanhã and Senna Madureira, and on the
River Acre, from its mouth to Riosinho de Pedros, shall be contracted
for by public bidding, or independently of bidding, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
corporations sufficiently able, under the rule established by
decree, number 6,368, Feb. 14, 1907 or others which may not
be more onerous and may permit the assurance of the opening
of navigation more rapidly on the sections of the rivers to be
improved.</p>

<p>Art. 59. In none of the contracts shall a longer term than
7 years be granted the contracting party, to count from the date

with the destruction and regulating of the Cujubim
rapid, so that from now on navigation is assured during the
Winter to Villa Boa Vista.</p>

direct conservation of these works are under the supervision of
the Minister of Transportation; but before the respective contract
is signed, copies of the plans and descriptive memorandum
referring to the project shall be furnished the Minister of Agriculture,
so that he may be heard upon the opportunity and the
order in which these works shall be executed, in the interest of
the economic development of the region, and that they may be
conveniently attended by those casually interested in the colonization
and development of the industries along the banks of the
rivers, or in commerce in general.</p>

<p>In case it is found that the destruction and regulation of the
Cujubim rapid cannot be done during one season of low water
in the river, the Minister of Agriculture, by agreement with the
State of Amazonas, can order to be constructed a Decauville
line of the type described in articles 45, second part and 51,
in the belt line constructed by that State along waterfalls, so

<h3>RUBBER IN THE STATE OF AMAZONAS</h3>

<p class="center">General Ideas about the State. Progress in the Means of Transportation.
Climatological Conditions.</p>

<p>The State of the Amazonas is the largest one in the Brazilian
Republic. Notwithstanding its well-known natural resources that
are not limited, according to many persons, to the precious milk
of the rubber tree—that wonderful tree of fortune—which is disputed
by various producing centers, its vast territory is yet far
from being completely and properly populated.</p>

<p>The emigration currents towards that section have started
lately, so that the population of hardly over two hundred thousand
souls a few years ago, to-day is over six hundred thousand
inhabitants, without any exaggeration.</p>

<p>As such changes are taking place the conditions of life are
being altered every day. It is true that there still prevails in
the books of gay tourists who consider humbug as a condition
of inexhaustible success, the impression that the native indians
travel about half nude and armed with arches and arrows, chasing
the lost Europeans through such outlandish regions of the world.</p>

<p>The remark, however, is not based on real facts. The native
Indians are not now to be found in very accessible places. The
foreigner who lands in the Amazonas capital, for instance, may
be sure that his habits and his civilization will not cause any
fright.</p>

<p>It is difficult to find among the natives who possess some
education and means one who has not been through several
European countries, especially France; so that as soon as the
visitor lands he notices an atmosphere of modern improvements
and all the novelty and gay spirit of Parisian life; the latest
fashions are found at once in Manáos.</p>

<p>The progress of that beautiful princess of the Rio Negro
(Black River) is most remarkable, because it is at the most only
twenty years. Until the proclamation of the Republic in Brazil,
Manáos amounted to almost nothing. From 1889 to this date
began its stupendous development, counting already over 60,000
inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>To-day it has comfortable homes, good and solid buildings
of artistic architecture. Its port is perfectly fitted to receive
the visits of the large transatlantic steamers, which places it
in communication with the leading European ports. The navigation
line for the United States, served by an English company,
is not yet of the required progress to insure all the necessary
comfort to the passengers who venture to undertake the long
trip. Furthermore, it is served by steamers that do not possess
the modern requirements of speed, which at present is of first
interest not only for the passengers who look for a pleasure
resort as well as for the intercourse of commercial relations with
the world’s markets. That is the reason why the interchange
between Amazonas and New York has been rather slow, which
interchange could be of greater magnitude than it is to-day if
there was a more intimate knowledge between the parties.</p>

<p>I would not want to end this information about the capital
of the State of Amazonas without quoting some paragraphs
from the excellent work, “The Rubber Country of the Amazon,”
written by Mr. Henry C. Pearson, Editor of the “India Rubber
World”:</p>

<p>“When one considers that this city is a thousand miles from
the seacoast, in the heart of a vast tropical jungle, with wild
Indians within a hundred miles of it, its presence seems incredible.
In a way, it is as modern as New York or Chicago. The
latest Parisian fashions are there, and almost anything that
civilized man desires is obtainable. Prices are high, to be sure,
because both luxuries and necessities are imported and subject
to a duty of 100 per cent. But when something besides rubber
is produced by the magnificently fertile lands that surround it,
Manáos will be one of the great and beautiful cities of the world
and living as reasonable as anywhere.”</p>

<p>That progress, although it has been made principally in
Manáos, in some form is also affecting the interior of the State.
The river navigation is made quicker than before and on elegant
and up-to-date steamers, which navigate throughout all the tributaries
of the Amazon River.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the Madeira-Mamoré railroad has produced a
great improvement in the transportation facilities adopted in the
State for the quick delivery of merchandise in the interior.</p>

<p>The most distant points of the territory are now connected
by wireless telegraphy. The news of the world can be transmitted
daily to the capital of the State by means of double river
cable and by wireless telegraphy of the Marconi system.</p>

<p>The climatic conditions are not so terrible as pictured in
the minds of the outside people, who do not know the real facts
and the true geographic situation of the State.</p>

<p>Mr. A. R. Wallace, in his “Narrative of Travels on the Amazon
and Rio Negro,” and Captain Maury, in his book “The
Amazon and the Atlantic Coast of South America,” show themselves
so enthusiastic over the climate of Amazonas and recommend
it “as one of the healthiest and mildest in the world.” That
easy enthusiasm is not so good for us as the competent French
engineer, Mr. Paul Le Cointe’s opinion, after many years in the
northern part of Brazil. Thus he expresses himself:</p>

<p>“The Amazonia, an immense tableland slightly concave, situated
entirely in the tropics, crossed by rivers of colossal dimensions,
with lakes and swamps, the remains of the original water
basin, badly separated by modern alluvium land, covered with
impenetrable forests from which emerge here and there some
plains, ought to have a specially hot, damp and unhealthy
climate.</p>

<p>“That is the reputation which it has enjoyed for a long time
and which has frightened away the European immigration; but
it is not deserved in such an absolute manner; as a hot country
is perhaps on the contrary the less deadly for the settler as
well as for the traveler.”</p>

<h3>THE AMAZON AS RUBBER PRODUCER</h3>

<p>It is indeed very difficult if not absolutely impossible to limit
the rubber producing region of Amazonas. In almost the whole
of the vast territory of that State there are found rubber trees
and where they do not grow, they certainly can be successfully
planted. Over large tracts of lands on the banks of rivers not
navigable, there are extensive rubber forests not explored on
account of lack of population.</p>

<p>That exuberance of the Amazonian flora, that arrangement of
nature to furnish resources to the rubber extractor for many
years, kept him away from any other occupation except that of
raising the arm and wounding the tree of fortune in order to
obtain prosperity. There was no necessity of planting that which
the open road of the forest presents at each step; also why
worry with a view to obtaining any other process of securing
the “<b>hevea brasiliensis</b>” when its milk in the primitive state is
obtained at the lowest price of exploitation and cultivation, preserving
all the excellent qualities of the rubber?</p>

<p>The presence of competitors in the world’s market, more
than the damage caused to the health by the smoking process
of coagulation, is the reason to establish new exploitation. The
rubber plantation is now being conducted perhaps without obeying
the scientific criterion, but more in the shape of facilitating
the gathering of the <b>latex</b>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span></p>

<p>One hears a good deal about high prices in the Amazonas,
and careless observers state in opposition to that the cheapness
of life in the Asiatic Islands and other points of the world. I
do not think that a thoughtful person without any interest in
connection with enterprises and plantations elsewhere in the
world, would be able to use such an assertion, which is so
unjust.</p>

<p>The French engineer, Mr. Paul Le Cointe, who is an expert
in the matter, writes the following:</p>

<p>“For the work to be executed, the number of workmen required
is much less where the production of those men is high,
hence to calculate the price of hand work, the individual production
is the factor that may become more important than the pay
to the men who work by the day.</p>

<p>“In the Far East, the workmen are paid from Fr. 75 to Fr.
1.25, equal to 14 cents to 23 cents, approximately, including feeding.
In the Amazonas, the pay per day amounts to Frs. 4.75,
or that is, almost 91 cents for all the work, which is three to four
times more.”</p>

<p>Let us examine the cost in Asia and in the Amazonas for
the different work required by the cultivation of the rubber
trees.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Stanley Arden, it is about 38 cents for
each kilogram of rubber in the plantation (the data that I am
presenting in connection with this matter is from the book of
Mr. Le Cointe, entitled “Le Caoutchouc Amazonien et son Concurrent
Asiatique”).</p>

<p>Mr. Lamy Torrilhon speaks about the Kuala Lampur Rubber
Company (Malay), which had in 1909, 404,012 rubber trees
from one to six years old. Calculating the price of cultivation of
that rubber at Fr. 4 per kilogram or approximately 76 cents,
Mr. Stanley Arden also calculated that the cost of a hectar of
plantation before reaching the period of exploitation (the sixth
year, according to him) was only Fr. 816, or more or less $157,
including the salaries and establishment of European employees,
and Mr. M. G. Vernet, of the Pasteur Institute of Nha-Trang,
calculated Fr. 3,000, about $580.</p>

<p>Mr. Le Cointe further states that Mr. Stanley Arden in his
calculations of expense seems to presume the plantation in lands
not thickly wooded, because he counts for the burning and clearing
of the land, hardly one-third the cost of felling the trees,
when in the forest it is about the same. Of course, lands not
properly protected and in the virgin state in the tropical countries,
are less fertile than those covered with thick forests, furthermore
the lands that have been devoted to a prolonged cultivation
of plants, like coffee, tea, etc., are to a large extent exhausted,
and if rubber trees were attempted to be planted there,
the result would be that it would largely lose the advantages by
having to fell new trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus17" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus17.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>BRANDING RUBBER ON THE SAND-BAR.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Le Cointe also speaks of about 225 trees per kilogram,
when practically that number can be doubled; besides this the
calculation made by the same author of about $18 for the clearing
of the hectar, at the rate of $14 per day for each workman
shows that the price for that work in almost clean land will take
sixty-two days, whereas in the Amazonas we only count on
twenty-six days for each clearing of a hectar in a virgin forest.</p>

<p>This argument, it seems to me, shows that there is a purpose
to bring up a cheapness which is more apparent than real, with
the determination of recommending the Asiatic plantations to
the detriment of the Amazonas rubber plantations.</p>

<p>This plan of attack is not the most correct one. We have
the advantage of having workmen who easily adapt themselves
to the producing land, and with the measures of protection that
the Government is going to guarantee to the rubber planters,
the life of the contractor is going to become easier.</p>

<p>The tree which is planted in its own region, is less subject
to ravages, being less persecuted by the destroying parasites, is
not violently fell by hard winds.</p>

<p>As every day increases the number of industries which requires
rubber as a raw material, it is therefore necessary to
exploit it in different centers, counting even with possible disaster,
but nowhere in the world, in accordance with the most
reliable statistics, is there more favorable land for the planting
of rubber trees than in the various territories of the Amazonas.
That territory has been placed by nature to be the emporium of
that industry, and counts with all the means to preserve that
privilege, and for the guarantee of the planter as soon as the
rubber tree develops itself, it has other resinous trees suitable for
construction, and excellent fibres which can be sold at a profit.
The Brazilian walnut is so abundant there that it is a second
source of income in the State of Amazonas.</p>

<h3>THE PRODUCTION OF RUBBER</h3>

<p>Only during the first six months of this year, notwithstanding
that the time for the full crop was not as yet due, from Manáos
there were exported to the United States 2,328,389 kilograms of
fine rubber, 602,180 medium quality, sernamby 991,088, caucho
798,024; to Europe, first quality 2,449,776, medium quality 407,278,
sernamby 507,860, caucho 1,368,489; from Itacoatiara, first
quality 37,240, medium 3,858, sernamby 26,237, caucho 11,405,
that is for the Amazonas a total of 9,531,824 kilograms, almost
half of the export of 22,902,401 kilograms made in that period
for that State, besides that of Pará and Iquitos. The production
of Amazonas in 1910 was 10,466,231 kilograms; in 1911, 10,122,242;
this year, it is expected that there will be an increase of
more than 15 per cent of the production of last year.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span></p>

<p>This is due only to the active work of a few thousand workmen.
What would be the colossal production of that territory,
when the work of the men will be facilitated by a rational distribution
of rubber trees!</p>

<p>Reflecting upon that, I am reminded of the words of Dr.
T. Huber:</p>

<p>“A regular planting industry will have a marked and salutary
influence upon the extraction of wild rubber and the management
of wild rubber forests.”</p>

<p>Furthermore, I have the full conviction that the future of
that industry competently managed will offer in Amazonas, and
in order to be more exact, in Brazil, more guarantees of success
than in any other region in the world.</p>

<h3>STATE OF AMAZONAS</h3>

<p>The main stream of the River Amazon flows through the
entire territory of this State, and within its boundaries is joined
by many tributaries.</p>

<p>The boundary with the State of Pará is formed by the same
river, and that with Matto-Grosso and the Republic of Bolivia by
the Upper Madeira River. The River Javary, a tributary of the
Solimões (or Upper Amazon), forms the boundary with Perú, as
does the Upper Rio Negro (the waters of which connect with
the Orinoco through the Cassiquari Canal), with Venezuela.
Before the formation of the Federal Acre Territory, the upper
reaches of the Rivers Acre, Purús, and Juruá also constituted
the frontiers of the State of Amazonas with Perú and Bolivia.</p>

<p>The capital of the State, Manáos, is situated in the bay of the
Rio Negro, three days distant by steamer from the capital of
the adjoining State, Pará. The nearest European port, Lisbon,
can be reached in thirteen days, and New York in eighteen days.</p>

<p>Manáos is the turning-point for ocean going steamers from
the United States of America, and Europe, as well as from the
South of Brazil.</p>

<p>The companies engaged in the transatlantic service are:</p>

<p><b>The Booth Steamship Co., Ltd.</b> (British), with four sailings
each way to and from Liverpool per month, calling at Itacoatiara,
Pará, Madeira, Lisbon, Leixoes (Oporto), Vigo and Cherbourg,
and three sailings to and from New York per month, calling at
Pará and Barbadoes.</p>

<p><b>The Hamburg-Amerika Line</b> and <b>Hamburg-Sudamerikanische
Dampfschiffahrts-Gesellschaft</b> (German), with two sailings per
month to and from Hamburg, calling at Pará, Madeira, Lisbon,
Leixoes (Oporto), Havre and Antwerp. <b>The Booth Steamship
Co., Ltd.</b>, also runs two lines, one from Liverpool and the other
from New York, as far as Iquitos, the capital and principal port
of the Loreto province of Perú. Maritime communication with
Southern Brazil is maintained by the “<b>Lloyd Brazileiro</b>” and the
“<b>Cia. de Commercio e Navegação</b>,” the former having six steamers
per month, and the latter three. The voyage from Manáos to
Rio de Janeiro occupies from 14 to 16 days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>The river navigation is controlled by the Amazon River Navigation
Co. (1911), Ltd., and numerous private steamers, which
form a flotilla only to be compared with that of the River Mississippi.
A new company “A Companhia Navegação do Amazonas”
is about to commence operations. All these steamers call at
Manáos, or have their headquarters there.</p>

<p>Telegraphic communication is as follows: By means of the
<b>Amazon Telegraph Co., Ltd.</b>, in combination with the Western
Telegraph Co. to and from all parts of the world.</p>

<p><b>Wireless Telegraphy</b> (Marconi and Telefunken systems), is
already making considerable headway. The Marconi station
at Manáos, in the hands of the Madeira Mamoré Railway Co.,
receives and transmits messages to and from Porto Velho, on
the Madeira River, the starting point and headquarters of the
railroad, as well as to and from the Telefunken stations at Senna
Madureira, Empreza and Cruzeiro do Sul (the capital towns of
the three divisions of the Acre Territory).</p>

<p>These last stations are not yet open for use by the public,
and other intermediate stations are still in course of construction.</p>

<p>Manáos has also a station of the <b>Amazon Wireless Telegraph
&amp; Telephone Co., Ltd.</b>, which transmits messages to Pará, and
has lately been in regular communication with the station in
Iquitos belonging to the Peruvian Government. By this route
it is possible to send messages to Lima, the capital of Perú, on
the Pacific Coast. However, the Company mentioned has so
far not succeeded in obtaining the official permission of the
Brazilian Government to operate in Brazil.</p>

<p>Manáos has a permanent population of upwards of 70,000
inhabitants. Its houses and public buildings conform to modern
architectural ideas, and some of its buildings, such as the State
Theatre, the Public Library, the Palace of Justice and the “Benjamin
Constant” Orphan Asylum are magnificent.</p>

<p>The streets, squares and avenues are well lighted by electricity
and the town possesses an excellent electric tramway system.
The drainage scheme is almost completed, and the water supply
is very satisfactory. The port works are in the hands of the
Manáos Harbor, Ltd. There are some excellent hotels, and a
splendid telephone service.</p>

<p>The following banks carry on operations in Manáos:</p>

<p><b>The London &amp; Brazilian Bank, Ltd.</b>, and <b>The London &amp;
River Plate Bank, Ltd.</b> (British), agencies.</p>

<p><b>Banco do Brazil</b> (Brazilian), agency.</p>

<p><b>Banco Amazonense</b> (Brazilian), Head Office.</p>

<p>Rubber is the chief industry of the State, being its principal
product and source of income. The predominance of this industry
dates from 1863, and within a few years it superseded entirely
the planting of rice, coffee, cocoa, sugar cane, beans and maize.</p>

<p>Up to 1870 rubber was generally exported in the form of
roughly made shoes, hats and caps, as well as in sacks and in
bulk, the greater part of it going to New York, via Pará. Later,
the present system of biscuits or balls, cut and packed in cases,
came into use.</p>

<p>Considerable business has always been done in Amazon with
the United States of America, although formerly the proportion
shipped to America was greater than at present, as it was only
in later years that the heavy competition by London and Liverpool
came into being.</p>

<p>As far as the wealth of rubber obtained from natural sources
is concerned, Brazil ranks first among all the world’s rubber
producing countries. While the East Indian section, with its
plantation grown product, has already outstripped her in the
quantity of its annual plantation output, the superior excellence
of genuine Pará rubber has not been attained. The “fine rubber”
that comes from the inundated region of the lower river country
is best known. In the upper districts of various southern affluents,
fine rubber trees grow, but no longer in the lowlands that
have long been subject to inundation, they occur rather in forests
that are overflowed seldom, if at all, that even extend over the
hilly districts. The method of collection and the entire operation
of rubber production varies in many respects from the
more familiar methods of the inundated districts. This applies
particularly to Acre, with its characteristic and peculiar river
section.</p>

<p>To explore this section, from economic and scientific points
of view, I undertook a journey last year, 1911, at the instance
of the Associação Commercial.</p>

<p>The results of this journey will be embodied in a detail report,
it is at present proposed to make only a brief summary to supplement
the pictures shown in the exhibition.</p>

<p>Our better knowledge of Acre dates back barely a quarter of
a century. At that period uncertainty prevailed as to which of
the countries adjoining Acre, Brazil, Bolivia and Perú, were the
owners of the territory. In more recent times these conditions
have been adjusted, the greater part having been awarded to
Brazil, while Bolivia received a portion of the left bank of the
upper Acre. The boundary between Bolivia and Perú is as yet
undecided. The latter country includes the uppermost left bank
of the source section which contains but few fine rubber trees.</p>

<p>The Acre is a right affluent of the larger tributaries of
the Purús, entering above the mouth of the Rio Negro and coming
from the Southwest, and flows, like these, through the
boundless forest tracts of the Amazon River country. It rises
in elevated ground, East of the Andes, in a still partly explored
territory, very difficult of access, at about the eleventh
degree of southern latitude and 70½ longitude and flows at
first eastward, to the Bolivian boundary at 69°. From this point,
the Acre flows first Northeast, with a constantly increasing
northerly inclination, until it enters the Central Purús at 8⅔
South latitude and 67½ longitude. The small steamers run
from this point to the junction with the Amazon and on to
Manáos in six to eight days.</p>

<p>In November more than 40 large and small steamers are
despatched from Pará and Manáos. They carry supplies for the
rubber district and load, for the return trip, fine rubber and
other caoutchouc varieties. Such steamers have, as a rule, a
cargo capacity of 100 to 300 tons. The largest, taking as much
as 500 tons, are at most 50 to 60 meters in length.</p>

<p>The journey from Manáos to the Purús, is usually accomplished
in one day. The Purús is a stately river, which, in its
lower reaches often attains a breadth of 1,000 meters and although
it gradually narrows, it always retains, until its confluence
with the Acre, a breadth of several hundred meters.</p>

<p>The trip to that point takes, as a rule, 12 to 16 days and except
for the last stretch of about three days, is open all the year.
Here is the place called Cochoeiras, where there are rapids,
which during the dry season of about four months, obstruct steam
navigation on the Purús. The Acre, on the other hand, has a
narrow but deep bed, is rarely over 100 meters wide and often
contracts to 50 to 60 meters. In the dense forests, there may
be seen, from time to time, clearings on the banks with the
<b>Baracâos</b> that are the stations for the fine rubber business. Also
occasional larger places of residence, villages and little towns,
where longer stops are often made, are encountered.</p>

<p>We first pass Antimary, at the mouth of a river similarly
named. Then we soon reach Porto de Acre, a large residential
place, where the steamers must have their papers passed and
pay duties.</p>

<p>This is the beginning of the Federal territory, which is separate
from the State of Amazonas and is subject to the central
government in Rio de Janeiro. Hardly a day’s journey up stream
lies the little town of Empreza, with its picturesque houses embowered
in foliage. It is the most important place on the lower
Acre and the second largest residential town in Acre Territory.</p>

<p>About three days’ journey up the river the town of Hapury
is reached, which contains several thousand inhabitants and
enjoys a considerable trade. It is the largest and most important
town in the entire Acre territory.</p>

<p>When at times in the river’s narrow water course there are
a dozen large steamers lying and a lively business intercourse
is everywhere in progress, the scene, in the depth of the primeval
forest, creates quite an imposing impression. Hapury is
considered already in the district of Alta Acre and from this
point, the difficulty of navigation increases, the breadth and
volume of water of the river alike decreasing. Very rapidly
during long, rainless periods, the river water level lowers and
the further progress of the steamers becomes impossible. They
must anchor at a convenient place and wait until the river rises
again. In lower Acre, where water is more plentiful, such interruptions
are less frequent, but in upper Acre they are the rule.
The farther the river is ascended the more frequent are these
compulsory stoppages, often lasting eight to fourteen days. High-water
in the river often lasts but a few days, so that the steamers
must stop again. Then too, the many windings of the river
make navigation exceedingly difficult. On the upper Acre travel
is by day only, boats laying to at night.</p>

<p>Following the course of the river, 85 kilometers above Hapury,
Igarapé de Bahia is reached, on the Bolivian border and
then the little town of Cobija. It is situated on the right bank
and belongs to Bolivia, whereas on the left bank, Brazilian territory
continues. The steamers here are subject to the Bolivian
customs regulations and must pay duty on all goods destined
for Bolivia.</p>

<p>A large number of the steamers that start from Manáos, go
only as far as this or as Hapury, only a few venture to penetrate
further and are not deterred by the great loss of time.</p>

<p>Above Cobija are some of the most productive rubber sections
where there are goods to discharge and rubber to be loaded.
A few steamers follow the Bolivian border up to the terminal
station, Tacna. Here, as a small affluent from the right, the
Taverija flows into the Acre, forming at the same time the
boundary between Bolivia and Perú.</p>

<p>Bolivia maintains here a small military post, whereas there
is only a commissioner for Perú. If the steamer has met with
favorable conditions, the trip from Manáos may have been made
in a month; ordinarily, however, it takes two or three months.
The return trip is made much faster, some steamers, that do
not stop, make Manáos from upper Acre in fourteen days.</p>

<p>Above Tacna there are but two rubber forest districts or
seringaes as they are termed, the Seringal Auristella on the
Peruvian side and the Seringal St. Francisco on the Brazilian
side. The latter is a very productive and still young rubber
forest, farther up the river the fine rubber trees suddenly cease
and their output is no longer remunerative.</p>

<p>The climate, like that of the Amazon country, is humid and
hot, with a rainy and a dry season. The southerly situation,
however, causes a somewhat more marked difference between
the two seasons. In April, the rains become less frequent and
then, until October, there are no or but very few heavy precipitations;
some times the fallen leaves on the ground in the woods
are dried out and even the dew is absent. There then occur,
however, especially in the months of June, July and August,
steady cold spells, when the thermometer, in the morning, sinks
to 8° C. and often does not go above 12° C. during the day.
These so-called <b>Friazens</b> last several days and are recurrent, but
cease in September. Thunder storms and violent rain storms
begin in October, so that in November the rivers are usually
navigable again. In December the first steamships arrive. In
January and February a rainless period is frequent, which is
followed, in March and April again, by a rainy spell. Many
steamers undertake, usually at this time, their second voyage
and if they have good fortune they make three trips to upper
Acre.</p>

<p>The copious precipitation, the heat and the fertile soil have
produced in Acre a luxuriant primeval forest, which is higher
and more densely overgrown than that of the lower river courses
of the Amazon country. Trees of 40 to 50 meters in height
are not infrequent, they form a forest of varied composition.
There may be found here representatives of the most diverse
plant families; some of which, in the cool season, lose their
foliage. The forest is densely overgrown with plants, shoots
and shrubs. Where a thorny growth, Tapoea and other underbrush
gets the upper hand, a macheté or axe is necessary in
forcing a path through the virgin forest.</p>

<p>Various kinds of trees are used by the natives for building
houses, fashioning canoes and other purposes. For export, however,
neither these useful woods nor many other products of
the forest, have attained any importance. The fruit of the cacao
tree and Pará nuts, rot on the ground, transportation to Manáos
being too costly. The caoutchouc products are, however, present
in such abundance and possess such great value, that their acquisition
and transportation recompenses every effort and have
been the cause of the development in these distant primeval
forests of a busy life.</p>

<p>The water in the deeply hollowed bed of the Acre, swells
in flood time and submerges the land on the adjacent shores
and some sand banks, but for the most part does not penetrate
into the forest or only for a short period. The flooded forests of
the lower water courses, often miles in extent, are lacking and
the fine rubber trees grown on land free from inundation, often
reaches up into the hills in the hilly or mountainous district.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>The fine rubber tree belongs to the Hevea brasiliensis, Mull.
Arg. or to their near families. It is higher and more vigorous
than the trees in the inundated districts and has somewhat larger
and longer seeds. Trees of more than 40 meters in height and
up to five meters in circumference, are not rare. Whether the
Acre fine rubber tree is a special species or a variety of Hevea
Braziliensis, can be determined only by a very painstaking investigation.
In yield of rubber and quality of product, the Acre
tree surpasses that of the inundated districts.</p>

<p>Of other Hevea varieties Hevea cuneata Hub. the Seringa
vermelha, occurs but rarely, also sapium tapurú, Ule, is found
but rarely. Castillôa Ulei, Warb., the “caucho” of the Peruvians,
is quite plentiful and is generally utilized, its exploitation
being regarded sometimes as more profitable than the fine rubber.
Just as in the Amazon country, under the title “caoutchouc,”
the product of castillôa is mainly understood, so, in
Acre, for the yield of the Hevea, the name “fine rubber” is used.</p>

<p>At present, there are on the Acre no unowned, unused lands,
but some of the seringaes in operation are capable of further
development. In lower Acre there are many seringaes that are
badly exhausted and furnish but a small yield. The rubber collectors
too, who, as is well-known, cut down the Castillôa trees,
are compelled to go further into upper Acre all the time to find
profitable work.</p>

<p>Acre territory is regarded as the most productive fine rubber
section, especially on its borders; on the little river Hapury and
towards the Taurumano, which belongs to the water-shed of the
Madeira, the output is said to be exceedingly rich. In proportion
to their longitudinal extent, the extent of the woods belonging
to Acre, in breadth, is comparatively small, for in a one or
two days’ journey, it is possible to reach the district of another
river. The rubber forest properties are consequently all measured
from the river and include usually, a territory of several
hundred square kilometers, often in fact, equal to small principalities.
Many owners have also several seringaes, often in
Bolivia and Brazil simultaneously.</p>

<p>In such a seringal on the river bank, the dwelling with warehouse
accommodations and sales-place, is erected, known as the
Baracâo in contradistinction to the small Baraken of the work
people.</p>

<p>About the Baracâo the forest is usually cleared to afford land
for planting and pasture for the cattle.</p>

<p>The management of the seringal and its entire business, proceeds
from the Baracâo. According to the extent of the seringal,
from twenty to several hundred work people are employed on it.
Through the entire forest, paths, known as <b>estradas</b>, are laid out,
from which all obstructive brush and hanging creepers, are cut
away with the macheté. These <b>estradas</b>, where possible, are laid
out in loops, so that they lead back to the starting point and are
so planned as to include from 100 to 150 fine rubber trees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span></p>

<p>Every seringueiro is allotted two or three <b>estradas</b> to work.
These seringueiros live in the interior of the forest in special
<b>baraken</b>, either with their families, or usually several together.
The different <b>baraken</b> are connected by broader roads that can
be traversed by mules.</p>

<p>In May or June, after the <b>estradas</b> have previously been put
in order, the gathering of fine rubber commences. The seringueiro
proceeds in the early morning into the forest, taps the
trees in the customary manner with the little axe Maschadi, attaches
the tin cups and afterwards collects the accumulated
milk. It is afternoon when he reaches home with the milk he
has collected in a rubber bag or in tin cans, to be smoked. In a
little hut, roofed with palm-straw, the smoking is proceeded with.
Pieces of wood that give a copious smoke are burned and over
the fire is placed a tin cylinder, known as a <b>Boião</b>. The seringueiro
first collects, in the middle of a round, strong stick, some
coagulated rubber milk and pours the still fluid milk, which he
has in a large tin dish, over this place, turning the stick so that
the smoke can impregnate the coagulating caoutchouc. He continues
this operation until the milk in the tin pan is all used up.</p>

<p>By this means, a rubber ball is produced which is enlarged
in the succeeding days until it weighs about 50 kilos. The stick
is then withdrawn and the ball, stored with others, until the
mule train comes for it. A mule can carry on each side of him
50 kilos without over-exerting himself.</p>

<p>If, however, the weight of the ball exceeds sixty kilos, the
mules are overloaded and the seringueiro who made the balls
pays a fine. Where the dwelling place of the seringueiro is near
a river and the fine rubber can be transported by canoe, larger
balls, that often weigh more than 100 kilos are made.</p>

<p>This gathering and preparation of the fine rubber differs
materially from that practiced on the lower water courses where
the milk is smoked with much greater care, on the shovel shaped
mould and the balls, as a rule, weigh but 10 to 30 kilos. On the
Acre, the seringueiro will gather in a day 15 to 25 liters of milk,
which will yield 7 to 12 kilos of dry rubber, whereas in the
inundated section he will be able to gather but one-half or one-third
as much. Of course the seringueiro can smoke the milk
much more carefully and take certain precautions, as for instance,
that the rubber-milk is never heated. On the Acre on
the other hand, the milk is warmed as a rule, because otherwise
the large mass is difficult to manage. There is no question but
that in this manner the quality of the rubber, which is prepared
from the best material and certainly would yield the best product,
suffers. Nevertheless the rubber balls from Acre, prepared in
the primitive manner, furnish a good and much sought for rubber.
The tapping of the trees also is often effected with less care,
small steel axes being used that make wounds that are too deep
and as a result, the seringaes in the Acre are exhausted more
quickly than those in the inundated district.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>From the <b>baracâos</b>, the stations on the banks of the river,
small mule trains proceed to the interior to bring in the rubber
balls, which are laid in rows, usually in the open air, so that they
will be thoroughly dried before loading them on the steamer. By
the same mules, food and supplies are sent to the seringueiros
in the forest. When the rubber gathering ceases in December
or January, the seringueiro has other important work to do.
Roads must be opened and repaired, clearings made in the forest,
huts erected, wood cut and finally the paths set in order for the
approaching harvest. During the rainy season, the steamer brings
new supplies and food, which the seringueiro must buy at the
<b>Baracâo</b>.</p>

<p>Concerning the duties the seringueiro has to perform, there
are special regulations, which prevail in most seringaes and of
which written or printed copies are often furnished.</p>

<p>To each seringueiro is allotted two or three estradas, each
with 120 to 200 trees. For this he pays 15 per cent of his gathering
of fine rubber to the owner of the forest and an additional
10 per cent if he uses the mules for transportation. The remaining
rubber belongs to the seringueiro in so far as he does not
have to pay it for goods purchased. As a rule, the owner purchases
a portion of the product on the spot at a price that is, of
course, somewhat lower than is paid in Manáos, the remaining
portion is shipped, for account of the seringueiro, to Pará and
Manáos, and he receives the full market price for it, of course,
after deducting freight and duties. The balance is placed to the
credit of the seringueiro and paid to the firm representing the
owner in Manáos or Pará. Certain items, for instance, the price
of Sernamby, consisting of residual scraps of rubber, the seringueiro
also receives in Acre. In some cases payments are made
in rubber products, a form of payment quite common in other
transactions.</p>

<p>On the upper Acre, a seringueiro will usually collect in a
day as much milk as will yield from 6 to 15 kilos of fine rubber.
Two liters of this milk yield a kilo of dry rubber, whereas with
Manihot Glaziovi, 3 liters are required for this. Exceptional
cases occur where the seringueiro furnishes milk for 20 to 25
kilos of fine rubber in one day. Daily collections of more than
40 liters, however, a single worker can hardly control and he
must then have an assistant for carrying and smoking. The
yearly production of a seringueiro amounts, in the better rubber
forest properties, to upwards of 1,000 kilos of dry rubber.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>Some owners offer a reward, such as for instance, a gold
watch, for the most industrious and luckiest seringueiro. On
the Seringal S. Francisco, for the crop year 1911-1912, a seringueiro
won the gold watch who had collected 2,500 kilos. The
annual highest yield of caoutchouc from the Castillôa was only
1,700 kilos, for the forest there in regard to Castillôa is already
very much exhausted. Otherwise the yields of this rubber are
more variable and higher than those of fine rubber.</p>

<p>If the price of rubber rules high, a seringueiro has quite a
considerable income and with a little frugality can acquire a
property.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, the price of rubber drops below five
milreis, the seringueiro has trouble to make both ends meet
with his income and easily gets into debt. The supplies that he
must purchase from the proprietor or his representative (lessee)
are very expensive. The customs duties, the long haul and
consequently high freight, the risk, the different losses, which
the proprietor suffers through debtor workmen, and the occasional
high price of fine rubber, which forces all prices upward, makes
everything in upper Acre very dear.</p>

<p>The prices of some of the most necessary supplies and goods
are about as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li>1 kilo mandioka flour, 2½ milreis.</li>
<li>1 kilo coffee, 4 milreis.</li>
<li>1 kilo sugar, 3 milreis.</li>
<li>1 kilo beans, 3 milreis.</li>
<li>1 kilo rice, 2½ milreis.</li>
<li>1 kilo dried meat, 5 milreis.</li>
<li>1 kilo fresh meat, 4 milreis.</li>
<li>1 chicken, 30 milreis.</li>
<li>1 dozen eggs, 10 milreis.</li>
<li>1 bottle brandy, 8 milreis.</li>
<li>1 meter goods, 3 to 6 milreis.</li>
<li>1 woolen quilt, 120 to 140 milreis.</li>
<li>1 pair boots, 40 to 60 milreis.</li>
<li>1 cake washing soap, 3½ milreis.</li>
<li>1 piece fine soap, 5 milreis.</li>
<li>1 macheté, 14 to 22 milreis.</li>
<li>1 package matches, 3 milreis.</li>
<li>1 carbine, 200 milreis.</li>
<li>1 kilo powder, 28 milreis.</li>
<li>1 kilo shot, 4 milreis.</li>
</ul>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>THE MOUTH OF THE ACRE.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span></p>

<p>1 pound sterling is now worth about 15 milreis, so that four
shillings (about one dollar U. S.)=3 milreis.</p>

<p>On the lower Acre, goods are much cheaper and they fall
still lower down to Manáos, where many articles only cost one-third
or one-fourth as much, or even less, but Manáos is nevertheless
an expensive city.</p>

<p>The large profits which fine rubber often yields, make all
labor very dear. For this reason agriculture has developed but
slowly and most food supplies must therefore be imported.
Nevertheless cattle raising is constantly growing, stock being
brought in from Bolivia. Bananas, the tubers of the sweet mandiola,
beans and some vegetables are extensively grown, especially
by Peruvians and Bolivians. Often the seringueiro will
plant some bananas and cultivate a small patch of cleared land,
but this is not favorably regarded by the proprietor. In some
seringaes, even the marriage of the seringueiros is opposed;
everything is directed towards obtaining the largest possible
quantity of fine rubber.</p>

<p>Although the Acre is not very full of fish, fishing, in the dry
season, is attended with some success, which particularly benefits
dwellers on the banks of the river. Hunting also, in some
sections, furnishes residents with fresh meat. As animals of the
chase may be enumerated, monkeys, Taca, Aguti, wild swine,
small varieties of deer, sloths, tapirs, various wood fowl and
ducks.</p>

<p>Very different from the arrangements customary, as a rule, in
the Acre, are the conditions in the Bolivian rubber districts,
which for the most part are owned by a single proprietor, N.
Suarez y Hermanos. He is said to produce 1,500 tons of fine
rubber per year, and could produce more than four times the
quantity if the entire forest concession, which is probably as
large as South Germany, was all put in operation. One portion
of this rubber forest is situated on the Acre, but the greater part
includes the Southwestern tributaries of the Rio Madeira. In
the properties on the Acre, the working methods are adapted to
Brazilian customs, especially where Brazilian seringueiros are
employed.</p>

<p>While in the Seringaes, trade is conducted mostly through
the Baracâos, there are in some places, notably in Cobija, Hapury
and Empreza, various business houses, through which the
owners of seringaes, captains of ships and other persons, can
supply their wants, for before the steamer returns, there is often
a scarcity in some products.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>The retail trade is mainly in the hands of so-called Turks,
various Orientals, from Syria, Arabia, Tunis and Morocco. They
have large boats, propelled by poles and oars and which contain
the goods in a covered space. These Turks travel as pedlars
for years about on the rivers, selling their goods for money or
rubber. This commerce is designated <b>Regatao</b> and is not favored
by proprietors, who sometimes forbid stopping in their territory.
The seringueiro can not only buy cheaper of them, but can dispose
of caoutchouc surreptitiously.</p>

<p>Those who encounter favorable conditions on the Acre, who
are diligent and economical, can, by working in the rubber industry,
or in any other field of activity, soon acquire a property.
The majority, however, squander their earnings on trips to
Manáos, Pará or Ceará, or suffer from sickness.</p>

<p>Although hygienic conditions on the Acre have improved with
the times and there are numerous healthy localities, malaria
still prevails there a great deal, and other diseases, notably beriberi,
are often fatally prevalent. Many privations, caused by
the difficulties of travel, and a certain amount of luxury, made
possible by the large earnings, often contrast with one another.</p>

<p>From Acre, during the year, about 5,000 tons of fine rubber,
inclusive of other rubber products, are exported, of which certainly
a portion comes from the adjacent territory.</p>

<p>This quantity, according to the price of rubber, will represent
a value of 20,000 to 75,000 contos of réis, about $5,000,000 to
$15,000,000. These are figures that play a part in the total output
of rubber, the importance of which is increased by its quality.</p>

<h4>THE ACRE TERRITORY.</h4>

<p>Previous to the Treaty of Petropolis, in 1903, between Brazil
and Bolivia, the Acre Territory formed part of the State of
Amazonas, one portion being, in fact, still in dispute. By virtue
of this treaty the Acre Territory became Brazilian, Brazil in
exchange paying £2,000,000 to Bolivia, an indemnity to an American
syndicate, and undertaking to construct the Madeira Mamoré
Railway.</p>

<p>The Congress then empowered the Federal authorities to administer
the Territory until the question should be finally settled.</p>

<p>The administration is much the same as that of the other
States. Recent laws have tended to decentralize the administration,
the latest being one giving municipal independence. The
three provinces of the Territory are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upper Purús (capital Senna Madureira),</li>
<li>Upper Juruá (capital Cruzeiro do Sul), and</li>
<li>Upper Acre (capital Empreza).</li>
</ul>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>TRANSPORT OF RUBBER BISCUITS.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span></p>

<p>The only product and export is rubber, the proportions during
1911 being:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Upper Purús</td>
    <td class="tdr">4,042,000</td>
    <td>kilos</td>
  </tr>

    <td>Upper Juruá</td>
    <td class="tdr">3,008,000</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Upper Acre</td>
    <td class="tdr">3,526,000</td>
    <td>kilos</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>One of the most serious questions has been that relating to
the ownership of land. The Federal Congress is prepared to
solve this problem satisfactorily, by recognizing bona-fide holdings
dating from before the Treaty of Petropolis, giving preference
to property deeds granted by the State of Amazonas, next
to those given by the Republic of Bolivia during its brief occupation,
and then to any possession obtained in good faith during
the whole interregnum, up to the date of the last law passed.</p>

<h4>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</h4>

<p>For the protection of Brazilian rubber, and in order to facilitate
and develop its culture, as well as its final handling, a Federal
law was passed on January 5th of the current year. (No.
2513 A.)</p>

<p>Its principal measures are especially concerned with Amazon
rubber and the country in which it is produced, viz.: the States
of Amazonas and Matto-Grosso and the Acre Territory. The
scheme embraces the construction of railways and roads, the
clearing of rivers, reduction of import duties and of dues on river
navigation, the establishing of coal depots, living accommodation
for laborers, centres for the production of foodstuff, model cattle
farms, prizes to rubber planters and exemption from import
duties on all material for rubber working.</p>

<p>Besides the Madeira Mamoré Railway, which benefits principally
the Madeira River district of Matto-Grosso, and a further
branch of the same railway, now in course of construction, and
which is intended to open up the Bolivian district of the Beni
River, the Brazilian Government will construct another railroad
(in the route of which the Commercial Association has suggested
some alterations) to commence from Manáos and to work through
the region of the Rio Branco, to link up with the English railroad
already constructed in British Guiana up to the Brazilian boundary.
This railway will open up to the State of Amazonas a huge
tract of country admirably suited to agriculture of all kinds, and
to colonization by Europeans.</p>

<p>The Association Commercial will also propose the construction
of a further railroad to communicate by means of branch
lines with the various provinces of the Acre Territory, in order
to bring the product of that region to the lower Purús River, at
a point which will admit of free access to steamers of deep draft
to and from Manáos.</p>

<h4>DR. CERQUEIRA PINTO’S PROCESS</h4>

<h5>EXTRA FINE PARÁ</h5>

<p>This rubber was cured for export in the rubber estate “IRACEMA,”
in the Federal Acre, Amazonia, Brazil, by Dr. Cerqueira
Pinto’s process of smokeless coagulation. (See The India Rubber
World, August 1, 1909, page 396, and copy of the same journal
of 1st September, the same year, page 435.)</p>

<p>The enclosed sample contains 68 kilos and belongs to the lot
of 5,000 kilos (11,025 lbs.) that Dr. Cerqueira Pinto holds to be
sold in New York.</p>

<p>Dr. Cerqueira Pinto’s process is one of coagulation of the
latex of the “<b>Hevea Brasiliensis</b>” by an ingredient patented by
the Brazilian Government—“<b>LACTINA</b>”—absolutely free of any
acid.</p>

<p>The latex after the coagulation is pressed through a cylinder
in order to dry out.</p>

<p>This rubber was tested and classified as of STANDARD type
by the Government of the United States of America.</p>

<p>It offers the resistance of 2,010 pounds per square inch according
to the experiments made by The Manhattan Rubber Company
in July, 1909. This rubber means a saving to the manufacturer
of at least 20 per cent, in the opinion of the Favorite
Rubber Mfg. Co. of New Jersey and of 25 per cent, as per the
analysis made in London.</p>

<p>The author of this process calls the Jury’s attention to his
rubbers and is willing to furnish with the sufficient quantity in
order to prove to the entire satisfaction of his assertions. It
vulcanizes as well by acid as by vapor. Dr. Cerqueira Pinto will
prepare, during the Exposition, in September, before the public
and the manufacturers, his rubbers with both Hevea and Castillôa
latexes, yield of the trees in October, 1911, in the Federal Acre,
Brazil. He shall present as well a large quantity of similar rubbers
cured by the author on different occasions. They are true
rubbers of commerce cured for export. They are clothed by a
vegetal varnish, soluble in water, which is also a discovery of
Dr. Cerqueira Pinto, to prevent the mould.</p>

<h5>CASTILLÔA OR CAUCHO.</h5>

<p>Prepared by the process of Dr. Carlos de Cerqueira Pinto.
(See the India Rubber World of September 1st, 1909, page 435).</p>

<p>The included sample weighs 68 kilos. The author holds 1,400
pounds of this quality to be sold in New York market.</p>

<p>The article was cured by rubber laborers of the estate “Iracema”
in the Federal Acre, Amazonia, Brazil, during the months
of July to December, 1911. They are rubbers of commerce and
cured for export.</p>

<h4 class="nobreak" id="MATTO_GROSSO">THE STATE OF MATTO GROSSO IN THE THIRD INTERNATIONAL RUBBER EXPOSITION
IN NEW YORK, 1912</h4>

<p class="center">BY<br>
LEOPOLDO DE MATTOS</p>

<p class="center">Dr. Joaquim Augusto da Costa Marques, President of the State
of Matto Grosso, 1911-1915</p>

<p class="center">The State of Matto Grosso, Brazil, at the Third International
Rubber Exposition in New York, 1912</p>

</div>

<p>Of the twenty states composing the Republic of the United States
of Brazil, Matto Grosso is second to the largest in its territorial
extension. It is situated south of the States Amazon and Pará,
having on the East the States of Goyaz, S. Paulo and Paraná,
on the South the Republic of Paraguay, and on the West Bolivia.</p>

<p>It embraces on the map that portion of the earth’s surface
which extends, approximately from the fourth degree South of
the Equator to the Tropic of Capricorn. Its immense area is
about 50,175 square leagues, or according to Mr. Candido Mendes
it has an area of 1,379,651 square meters. Its population is
actually about 350,000, not including a considerable number of
uncivilized Indians, whose improvement is carried steadily forward
by the united efforts of the State and Federal Governments.</p>

<p>Without mentioning its capital, the principal cities of the
State are Corumbá, S. Luiz de Caceres, Miranda, Nioae, Focoué,
Santa Aunade Paranabyba, Diamantina, Rosario, Livramento,
and the new and recently incorporated municipality, S. Antonio
de Rio Madeira. Its capital, Cuyabá, is situated on the left bank
of the river of the same name, 288 meters above sea level, and
owes its origin to the Paulistas, who formed colonies in the
western part of Brazil during the first part of the Eighteenth
Century.</p>

<p>In 1719 Paschoal Moreira Cabral ascending the River Coxipé
Mirim, founded on the left bank of this stream a village which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
was called Forquilha, but to-day is the city of Cuyabá, where
in those early days a rich gold mine was discovered. In those
days, according to Elysée Reclus, the vast region of Matto
Grosso, was hardly anything except a narrow, ordinary zone,
nothing more than an immense solitude of undefined limits and
unknown, but given over to Indians and wild beasts. It was
joined to the rest of Brazil by the lonely paths of hunters, and by
channels of the rivers that had their origin there. Really in
those days communication with the remainder of Brazil was as
difficult as with Matto Grosso. It is within the memory of many
and known to those who read the history of Brazil, that it was
impossible for the troops who were enrolled and equipped in the
coast provinces, to go directly to the aid of their compatriots in
Matto Grosso, when the Brazilian people had to respond to the
declaration of war by Paraguay.</p>

<p>With the thousands of obstructions in their path, a portion
of the army composed of 3,000 men, which left Rio de Janeiro
in April, 1865, and which could only be organized in Uberaba,
in the upper basin of Paraná, was reduced to about 700, when it
arrived at that safe and impregnable place.</p>

<p>The war with Paraguay being ended, there is no doubt that
the victory gained by Brazil opened wide the ports of Matto
Grosso, for the natural declivity of the soil, the course of the
streams, with the free river navigation, guaranteed by her triumph,
established a regular line of packets between Rio de
Janeiro, Corumbá and Cuyabá, by way of the River La Plata,
passing by Montevideo, Buenos Ayres and Assumption.</p>

<p>The fluvial ways of the Guaporé, Madeira and Amazon
were constantly used in the Eighteenth Century, after the exploration
made by Manoel de Lima in 1742. Navigation by
the Guaporé river to the Madeira, in short to S. Antonio, which
is the initial point of navigation on this last mentioned river, is
long and full of difficulties. Withal, Matto Grosso is gradually
approaching the coasts of Brazil by means of railroads, such as
the Northwestern Road, which will shortly unite it with Rio de
Janeiro, and the railroad, already projected, which, parting from
S. Luiz de Caceres, will reach the old city of Matto Grosso,
where the Guaporé begins to be navigable, to Guajará-Mirim, the
terminal point of the great Madeira-Mamoré Railway.</p>

<p>In a short time, as can readily be seen, these roads will be a
reality, the navigable rivers being united by the stretches of railroads
between them. The Paranápanema and the Ivahy in the
States of Paraná and S. Paulo, continue on the one side of the
Paraná River, ascending the Ivanhema, and the Brilhante, as
far as the neighboring mountains of Miranda, in the meridional
part of Matto Grosso.</p>

<p>The magnificent regions of Matto Grosso promise in the
near future, to be great centers of population and consequently
a future focus of civilization by probable fusion of the different
elements of immigration, which will certainly come together
there in the flight of time, and the increased facilities in the way
of transportation. Somewhere it has been said, that colonization
without doubt will come from the South, from Paraguay and
Argentina; but at the present time, with the completion of the
Madeira-Mamoré Railway, undoubtedly colonization will also
come from the North, communication being facilitated by the
Amazon River, the Madeira being one of its tributaries, on the
right bank of which is situated Porto Velho, the initial point of the
Madeira-Mamoré Railway. These effects are already commencing
to produce results as may be seen from founding of a new
municipality and district of Matto Grosso, called the municipality
of St. Antonio of the River Madeira, reached by the above-mentioned
railway and to which region we will devote a special
chapter later on.</p>

<p>Already one sees the farthest northern side of Matto Grosso
filling with people, while the southern side really contains the
greater number of inhabitants.</p>

<p>Matto Grosso is one of the regions of least roughness on the
continent of South America. There are no elevations of the
land which constitute real mountains.</p>

<p>The elevated lands have their points of culmination in the
western bases of the Mantiqueira, the Aymorés, and the Espinhaço,
and continue, gradually lowering from this side to the
West of Goyaz, and on the other side are the elevated lands at
the base of the Andes, which incline to the East with its supports.
Elysée Reclus says that an intermediary plain, separating
the two geographical districts, goes winding in the form of a
valley, that in other ages certainly was a maritime strait separating
the two islands—Western Brazil and the Andes.</p>

<p>To-day rivers run in the depression where formerly there
was a sea and the plain is actually full of alluvial soil. The true
center of South America is between the two cities of Cuyabá and
Corumbá.</p>

<p>To those who do not know the region, the slopes of the hills
are mistaken for mountains and geographical maps show a chain
of mountains more or less continuous, between the basins of the
Tapajóz and the Madeira, between the head waters of the same
Tapajóz and Paraguay and finally between the Tapajóz and the
Araguaya. Nevertheless this semi-circular plain exists only in
fragments, because the elevations which are found in the plains
of the upper Paraguay and its tributaries are only a high, level
ground of horizontal sections or slight elevations and worn away
by the rivers which flow into the great Amazon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>They are rather tablelands than mountains, for they do not
reach an elevation, except in some parts of the tableland, of more
than 100 meters, while the mean elevation of a range of mountains
is 500 meters.</p>

<p>This geographic district in the State of Matto Grosso is indifferently
called the cordillara of Parecys, but does not present a
mountainous aspect except on the South side. On this scarred
side, the rock is cut into peaks, or cut away into obelisks. On
the other side towards the Tapajóz and Xingú, a long range extends
and gradually declines into the plains of the State of
Amazonas. D’Orbiguy found in the high northern part of Matto
Grosso, the existence of beds pertaining to the carboniferous age
and corresponding to rocks of the same nature which on the
opposite side of that region are found in the Bolivian bases of
the Sierra of Santa Cruz. After this Hart and Derby verified
the fact that the southern parts of the Araxá, which are the
elevated borders of the tableland, date probably from paleozoic
epochs, and there are found the carboniferous, devonian and
silurian beds. Fossil beds found by the Geologist Smith below
the hillocks of the plains, 50 kilometers east of Cuyabá, place
these facts beyond doubt. More to the North is the zone of
the rocky places, which in links cut the Madeira, Tapajóz, Xingú,
Tocatius and their tributaries, the walls denuded by erosion, are
all of the crystalline formation, granite, gueis, porphory and
quartzite. The elevations that unroll in the direction of the
South, between the sources of the Paraguay and Araguaya, following
between the Paraguay and the Paraná, do not present the
same characteristics as the tablelands of the North. The high
parts of Western Matto Grosso were separated from the East
and West sides and devastated by lateral excavations, take in
certain places the aspects of true mountain chains, and for this
reason they are named, from the North to the South, the Sierras
of S. Jeronimo, Maracajú and Anhauhaly.</p>

<p>Eruptive rocks, called basaltic in this country, probably porphyritic
rend the beds of sandstone, of which the mountains are
composed and appear to form by their disintegration “red lands,”
similar to those which give the farmers of S. Paulo their abundant
harvests of coffee.</p>

<p>In a sort of circle limited by a semicircle of elevations isolated
masses have been lifted up, rocks whose outlines, seen
from a distance, have a perfect regularity. The hills proper, for
the greater part, have geometrical forms, which it should be
said, great forces have crumbled, leaving smooth walls like the
sides of pyramids. The tops of the tablelands, as well as summits,
have been maimed by a force certainly corresponding to
the other summits, which now may be seen as part of the same
prairie. According to Taunay, who traveled over the country,
these masses of sandstone in horizontal beds regularly placed
one above another, are formed of marshy sediment deposited
by the sea of fresh water, which in former times covered this
region.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>The ruins of these hills and slopes contributed also to change
the physiognomy of the landscape. These excoriations were
picked up and dragged by the rivers, to form new beds and
soil, and much rock disappeared below the continued crumbling
of the mountains. Others show nothing except their summits
above the land of recent formation. Masses that held them to
the tablelands and the chains of the interior are separated from
them, because their bases are buried and they emerge abruptly
from the soil. These distinctive peaks to which the name of
<b>itambea</b> has been given, raise their heads above a sea of trees,
like some great buildings erected by the hand of man. To the
East, the southern part of Matto Grosso, they range themselves
in files and group themselves in archipelagoes, each time becoming
higher and more numerous. The part that goes towards the
West are solitary peaks on the circle of the horizon and may be
seen along the banks of the River Paraguay, and even on the
other side of the same.</p>

<p>The Upper Guaporé, Itenez of the Bolivians, although situated
in the immense basin of the Amazon as a tributary to the
Madeira River by the Mamoré, belongs to the State of Matto
Grosso, for the city of this name was founded on its banks and
nearly the whole population of the state accumulated in this depression,
through whose western half the river finds its way. Its
principal source is very obscure. It rises in a grotto along the
border of the Araxá, and takes first a southerly course, parallel
to other rivers which descend towards Paraguay. On leaving
the last hills it curves to the West, and afterwards to the Northwest,
where already enlarged by numerous tributaries it crosses
the plain, where there is found the city named at its founding
Villa Bella and to-day called Matto Grosso.</p>

<p>The Paraguay is one of the most known rivers of South
America, as a way of navigation, as Elysée Reclus affirms. Few
rivers have such a slight declination in proportion to their length.
Castelnaw says that it rises at an altitude of 305 meters, in
places where tranquil waters glide slowly to the sea, the altitude
of the land being scarcely 200 meters. At a point 4,000 kilometers
from the sea, the declination is scarcely 5 centimeters.
Therefore, steamers of light draft can freely ascend to the confines
of Brazil, far to the North of the two Republics of Argentine
and Paraguay and arrive at the base of the tableland by
the principal river and its tributaries, Jaurú, Sepotuba, Cuyabá,
S. Lourenço and Taquary. The Paraguay presents another notable
phenomenon, which is the crossing its sources with those of
the tributaries of the Amazon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus45" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus45.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>SMOKING RUBBER.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>The River Jaurú approaches the Guaporé so closely that it
would be easy to make a canal from the waters of this western
river to a tributary of the Jaurú. Another tributary of the Paraguay,
the Aguapehy, is only separated from the Alegre River,
which flows by the old city of Villa Bella, to-day called Matto
Grosso, by a low and narrow isthmus, which according to
Leverger measures 5,280 meters. During 1772, and even later,
it was proposed to cut a canal at different places in this isthmus,
but the work was never done because of the little commerce of
that locality. Certainly, railroads, in the near future, will supply
the absence of a canal and will join Montevideo to Pará, passing
through the larger part of the State of Matto Grosso, and by a
continental navigable water way of 8,300 kilometers, as Bartholomo
Bossi says.</p>

<p>The Paraguay River has as its principal tributaries the S.
Lourenço, enlarged by the waters of the Cuyabá, the Taquary,
the Mondego, and the Apá, the last marking the boundary between
Brazil and the Republic of Paraguay. At the time of
the floods, its level, and that of its tributaries, rises 10 to 11
meters and overflows to the right and the left, forming a temporary
sea, which extends to great distances, being lost to sight
and continuing in lakes. The first Spanish explorers gave it the
name of Lake Xarayes, in its lower section, where it receives
the nearly dormant waters of its principal tributaries. This lake is
about 600 kilometers in length from North to South, between
the mouths of Jaurú and the hills of “Fecho-dos-Morros,” and in
certain places reaches a width of 250 kilometers.</p>

<p>It is not permanent, as you already know, but at certain
seasons of the year there are overflows, which the Indians called
bays and rightly, for here there were bays of an ancient sea,
which to-day are nearly dry, and most of these lakes are in constant
communication with the Paraguay River, either by underground
openings, or by long canals. These latter are called
the lakes of Uberaba, Gaiaba, Mandioré, Caceres, etc. Some of
these lakes contain only fresh water from the overflowing rivers,
while others being ancient cavities are now filled with salt water,
and have in their depths beds of salt, which give to the liquid a
soapy characteristic. It is singular that this contrast by nature
of fresh and salt water is also found in the lands of the vast
plains, and thus it is, that these extensive fields, covered by a
rich alluvial soil, bear heavy forests. Here the agriculturist can
certainly obtain marvelous harvests. It is certainly true that
these fields of Matto Grosso will serve for agriculture as well as
pastoral industry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span></p>

<p>The height of the lands, formed in the center of this vast
valley, hinders the tributary from remaining in a regular channel,
and the waters escaping from both sides ramify in a labyrinth of
rivers and false rivers. The lateral branches follow in the zones
of the lakes, to the confluence of the Taquary and Miranda
Rivers, which descend from the mountains on the East. These
receive in the upper region, a tributary called the Coxim, which
travelers consider one of the most picturesque rivers of Brazil.
It is curious to see, in some places, the waters of the Coxim
crowded between perpendicular walls 50 meters in height and
the small vessels floating on their bosom at the bottom of an
opening not more than 10 or 12 meters in width.</p>

<h5>THE CLIMATE</h5>

<p>The climate of Matto Grosso is relatively warm in the lower
parts and those overflowed by the high waters of the Paraguay
and other rivers. In the region of the tablelands the climate
is cool and healthy. The movement of the air columns is determined
by the open passage way between the Andes mountains
and the highlands of Brazil, as well as in the center of the
South American continent, and are held by it. The warm winds,
coming from the region of the Amazon, are succeeded in the
Winter time by the winds which blow from the cool pampas.
In the high parts of the circle of hills and mountains which surround
the tablelands of Matto Grosso, the cold goes below the
freezing point. The copious rains brought by the cooling winds
refresh the central tablelands of Brazil and then dash themselves
against the sides of the Andes. They fall with great regularity
in the Summer and are frequently accompanied by thunderstorms.
According to observations taken by some, the annual
fall of water is 3 meters, and in Cuyabá about 135 days of the
ordinary year are rainy ones.</p>

<h5>ITS SITUATION</h5>

<p>The State of Matto Grosso, from its geographical situation
in the Continent of South America, placed at the point of separation
of the two great basins of Brazil, contains at the same time
the flowers and faunae of the Amazon and Plata regions. Nevertheless,
the tropical flora predominates with its infinite variety
of vegetable forms in all the forest regions, that is to say, along
the banks of the rivers, and among the famous species found
along the shores of the River-Sea, there are few which are not
found in the region of the Upper Guaporé, and specimens of
which may not be seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>In no other parts, like here, will the development of Cipo’s
palm be found. In 1875, a boundary commission discovered
one of these palms <b>Urumbamba (Calamus procumbeus) or Des
Moncus rudentum de Martins</b>, of more than 20 meters in length,
with hardly the thickness of a centimeter. The cotton tree, tobacco,
ipecac, there called “poya,” grow spontaneously on the
plains and in the forests. The last grows abundantly in the
forests of the Upper Jaurú and the neighboring rivers. Maté,
the most notable product of the tablelands of the South, and
which has made some regions rich, as the State of Paraná, grows
here spontaneously between the Rivers Miranda and Apá, without
speaking of the seringa, which is found in immense and thick
forests in a district that extends from Cuyabá to Madeira and
which will be the special subject of this leaflet.</p>

<p>The woods for building are very abundant and of a great
variety, such as Brazil wood, Jacarandá, Peroba, Canella, Cedro,
Jequitibá, Massaran-duba, Arco, Ferro, Setim and Vinhatico.</p>

<p>Among the animals are found deer, tapir, panther, and also
a large number of small animals usually found in tropical regions.
The fowls and birds along the streams and the songsters in the
forests are, because of their variety, almost innumerable. The
ostrich is found in the region of the pampas and on the margins
of the upper Paraguay. There are many varieties of fish in
the large and small rivers.</p>

<p>In the mineral kingdom, the State of Matto Grosso has
numerous mines of gold, silver, platinum, copper, tin, mercury,
coal, iron, precious stones, diamonds, etc. There are already
four English companies developing gold mines. There is also
granite, crystal, malacacheta, limestone, sal-geunna, etc. Finally,
in the region of the Araxá, there are sulphur mineral springs.</p>

<p>In Matto Grosso are found the largest cattle ranches, not only
as to their territorial extent, but also as to the number of horses
and cattle, some of them numbering 100,000 head. The number
of cattle is calculated to be 2,000,500,000 head. Although the
transportation of cattle from Matto Grosso to Rio de Janeiro
is difficult, it is generally done by a road running West to
Uberaba, where they pass the Winter season of two or three
months and being recuperated are sent by railroad to Rio de
Janeiro. Hence it is easy to see that with the completion of the
Northwestern Railway of Brazil, the problem of transportation
to the coast will be solved. Also with the completion of the
Madeira-Mamoré Railway the navigable rivers of Matto Grosso,
will in short time, be linked with the port of Pará. Before long
another railway will extend from S. Luiz de Caceres, the ancient
city of Matto Grosso, where the River Guaporé commences to
be navigable to Guajará-Mirim, the terminal point of the
Madeira-Mamoré Railway. This will solve the problem of the
transportation of cattle to the States of Amazonas, Pará, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>From this brief exposition one concludes that the State of
Matto Grosso is very rich in cattle and gold, diamonds and coffee,
tobacco and maté, rubber and ipecac, and all other products
of the tropical and temperate zone. Without doubt it will come
to be one of the largest and richest empires of the world.</p>

<p>Endowed with a warm climate in the North, it has in other
regions a temperate and even cold climate. The tablelands
contain a rare accumulation of wealth, yet little explored. Naturally
people, in their activities and progressive conflict for a livelihood,
will come here from all parts of the world. By their intelligence
and endeavors they will make that part of Brazil an industrial,
commercial and maritime mart. Here from the fusion
of the different races, a great civilization will arise, and mankind
will progress onward and upward to the final conquest of
the land.</p>

<h5>RUBBER</h5>

<p>The rubber sent to this Exposition, comes from the vast
regions served by the Rivers Machados, or Dgy-Paraná, Jamary,
Jacy-Paraná, Mutum-Paraná, Paca-Nova and Guaporé and their
tributaries, which in turn are tributaries of the great Madeira
River, on whose right bank is situated the new municipality St.
Antonio do Rio Madeira, installed July 2, 1912.</p>

<p>The new municipality has the following limits: Starting at
the falls of St. Antonio do Rio Madeira, on parallel 8° 48′, the
River Madeira above; the River Madeira above to the mouth
of the Guaporé on parallel of 12°, and on this parallel to its intersection
with the River Camararé; on this river below to its confluence
with the Juruema; on this river below to the point where
it unites with the Arinos; on the parallel at this point which
passes to its intersection with S. Manuel River; it follows this
river down to its confluence with the Tapajóz; and from this
point back to St. Antonio Falls, along the line that divides
Matto Grosso from the Amazonas. All this immense territory
of the new municipality is traversed on the North by the
Madeira-Mamoré Railway, which was completed and opened
for traffic, September 7, 1912. It starts at Porto Velho and
terminates at Guajará-Mirim, a distance of 390 kilometers.</p>

<p>The Madeira-Mamoré Railroad, in addition to the stations
already opened in Porto Velho, Candelaria, St. Antonio, Jacy-Paraná,
Abunã, Villa Murtinho, and Guajará-Mirim has 46 places
of stopping, which corresponds to the number of camps.</p>

<p>Among the ways of communication that St. Antonio do Rio<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
Madeira, the new municipality, has with the neighboring States
of Amazonas and Pará, as well as with the capital and other
cities of Matto Grosso, we would mention the telegraph line
which the Federal Government is constructing along with its
public road ways. There are two gangs of engineers and workmen
engaged in the construction of the telegraph line. One
started at St. Antonio in the North, and the other at Diamantina
in the South. Leaving St. Antonio the telegraph line follows
parallel 8° 48′ until it comes to the River Jamary, a distance of
about 60 kilometers. Arriving there its course is changed to the
headwaters of the Dgy-Paraná River, to a place called Urupá.
Here it will meet and be joined to the line coming from the
South. On June 3, 1912, at the very headwaters of the Dgy-Paraná
River, the telegraph station of José Bonifacio was opened,
by the gang from the South, while those from the North had,
previous to this, opened the stations of St. Antonio do Rio
Madeira and Jamary. This notable undertaking is under the
efficient and extraordinary devotion of the Colonel of Engineers
of the Brazilian army, Candido Roudon, who has a record for
the construction of telegraph lines in Brazil and South America.</p>

<p>Within a year, more or less, the telegraph line will follow
along a roadway 40 meters wide, and about 200 leagues in length,
extending from Cuyabá to St. Antonio on the Madeira River.
This immense roadway of communication cutting all this vast
interior, rich in rubber and gold, will have a telegraph station
every 10 leagues. In Porto Velho, the initial point of the Madeira-Mamoré
Railway, there is already working a wireless
telegraph station of the Marconi system. There is daily communication
with Manáos. Also with Iquitos and with the Federal
department at Acre, Purús and Juruá.</p>

<p>Transportation from Manáos to St. Antonio on the Madeira
River is made in good condition and comfortable vessels. During
the time of low water, that is during the dry season of the
great Amazon and its tributaries, only vessels of 500 tons can
ascend to those places from Manáos. In the time of high waters,
when the valley of the entire Amazon is overflowed, the trans-Atlantic
steamers of 7,000 to 9,000 tons, ascend in four days
from Manáos. This has been done in the transportation of
materials for the construction of the Madeira-Mamoré Railway.
The vessels easily approached and made fast to the two wharves
made of wood, one of which is in front of the offices at Porto
Velho and the other at Candelaria. The Government of the
Republic, however, has determined to build of stone and lime
the wharves between Porto Velho and St. Antonio on the River
Madeira.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus47" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus47.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>RUBBER ON THE BEACH READY FOR SHIPMENT.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>The small steamers which navigate during the dry season,
have accommodations for first and third class passengers, are
lighted by electricity, have an artificial ice plant and make the
voyage from Manáos to Porto Velho and St. Antonio in about
five days, at the average speed of ten miles an hour, calling at
the small Amazonian ports and cities situated on the banks of
the Madeira River. In descending the river both the large and
small steamers make the voyage in from three to four days.</p>

<p>The rubber from St. Antonio on the Madeira River is of the
same physical and chemical constituents as all the rubber of the
Amazon Valley. This is worth remembering, when we think
of this new municipality in the State of Matto Grosso, being
the frontier of the States of Amazonas and Pará.</p>

<p>In the Manáos market, where the rubber comes by way of
the Madeira River, and in that of Pará, which it reaches by way
of River Tapajóz, it is always quoted at the same price and
under the same conditions as those produced in the regions of
the Amazon proper.</p>

<p>The production has been increasing annually since 1906 and
is actually about 2,000,000 of kilos annually. This will certainly
increase to an amount that cannot be foretold, with the
completion of the Madeira-Mamoré Railway, the wagon road
and telegraph line and the constant improvements in navigation.</p>

<p>During the first six months of the current year, the production
of rubber was greater than for the same length of time in
any year since 1907, as can be verified from the report annexed.</p>

<p>In those regions, between Cuyabá and the new municipality,
there exist rubber (seringa) forests capable of producing in one
year, more than 40,000,000 of kilos of rubber.</p>

<p>To attain this ideal, it is only necessary that the captains of
industry should join in the development of extraction. This
fountain shoots forth from the earth spontaneously without the
necessity of cultivation. To encourage and stimulate those who
wish to employ there, their endeavors and capital, the law of the
State of Matto Grosso offers special favors. These are offered
to those who wish to develop the vast forests of rubber existing,
as well as to those who wish to plant and cultivate the <b>Syphonia
elastica</b>.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Rubber Exposition soon to be held in New
York, it is proper to call attention to the well-known fact that
already the capitalists of North America have begun the development
of that region.</p>

<p>The large capitalist, Percival Farquhar, of North America,
has already incorporated two rubber companies, the Muller and
Guaporé, under the social terms of July, for the purpose not
only of developing the extraction industry of the <b>hevea</b> braziliensis,
but also for the different branches of agriculture necessary
for the making of sugar, cotton cloth, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>Actually the extraction of rubber in the vast seringaes of
the municipality of St. Antonio of the River Madeira employ
about 5,000 workmen. This number will constantly increase, as
the said municipality becomes the center of the currents of commerce,
industry and agriculture, from Matto Grosso and the
Republic of Bolivia.</p>

<p>This is easy to imagine, when we see that the Madeira-Mamoré
Railway will place it in communication to the South with
S. Luiz de Caceres, by means of the River Guaporé, and by the
railway, which, from S. Luiz de Caceres will extend to the ancient
city of Matto Grosso, thus joining the basin of the Plata—by
means of the Paraguay River, to the basin of the River Amazon.
And to the West the same Madeira-Mamoré Railway, reaching
to Ribeira-Alta, will bind the vast and rich regions of the Bolivian
Republic to the basin of the Amazon, by means of the Madeira
River. Presently the chief engineer and director of the
Madeira-Mamoré Railway, Mr. H. Dose, will leave for that
region, to begin the construction of the branch Guajará Mirim—Matto
Grosso, to Ribeira Alta, Bolivia, which will be finished
within a year and a half, and be about 100 meters long.</p>

<p>In addition to this with the prompt construction within a year
of the wagon—telegraphic line—roadway from Cuyabá to St.
Antonio on the Madeira River, we can easily conclude, that the
municipality of St. Antonio on the Madeira River, will indeed
become the converging point of these great and strong currents
of development of progress and of civilization.</p>

<p>In conclusion it should not be forgotten that this territory
herein described serves not only for the production of rubber,
which there, as in the whole valley of the Amazon, is native
and grows according to the laws of nature. It also should be
mentioned that cacao and cotton are native, while there can
be planted and cultivated, sugar cane, coffee, vanilla, corn, beans,
rice, tobacco, potatoes, brazil nut, etc. The Madeira-Mamoré
Railway Company has the concession of a vast amount of land
along its line, which it proposes to plant in cacao, sugar cane,
etc., thus improving these lands.</p>

<p>From this description, in which we have endeavored to set
forth only the truth, giving the facts concerning the region in
question, it can be concluded that the new municipality of St.
Antonio on the River Madeira, which actually exports to the markets
of the world, via Pará and Manáos, about 2,000,000 kilos
of rubber, will in a few years, with immigration and from other
causes, export from 10 to 15,000,000 kilos.</p>

<p>The author of this article asks indulgence for any shortcomings
it may contain, as it was written in the spare moments
he could find, while laboriously collecting the samples of rubber
and putting them on board the steamer at Manáos for New York.</p>

</div>

<p>Dos vinte Estados que compõem a Republica dos Estados
Unidos do Brasil, Matto-Grosso está collocado em segundo
plano, pela sua extensão territorial situado ao Sul dos Estados
do Amazonas e Pará, tendo a Leste os Estados de Goyaz, S.
Paulo e Paraná, ao Sul a Republica do Paraguay e a Oeste a
Republica da Bolivia.</p>

<p>Abrange no mappa uma porção que vae approximadamente
desde o 14° grao ao Sul do Equador até o Tropico do Capricornio.
Sua área immensa é de cerca de 50175 leguas quadradas, segundo
Candido Mendes, ou melhor, tern uma superficie de 1379651 kilometros
quadrados.</p>

<p>Sua população é actualmente de cerca de 350,000 habitantes,
não incluindo consideravel numero de indios bravios, cuja
cathechese se procede com afinco, dia a dia, com o concurso simultaneo
dos Governos Federal e Estadoal.</p>

<p>Sem contar a Capital, as cidades principaes do Estado são
Corumbá, S. Luiz de Caceres, Miranda, Nioac, Poconé,
Sant’ Anna de Paranahyba, Diamantina, Rosario, Livramento e o
novo Municipio recentemente installado de Sto. Antonio do Rio
Madeira.</p>

<p>Cuyabá, sua capital, está situada á margem esquerda do rio
do mesmo nome, a 288 metros acima do nivel do mar, e deve
as suas origens aos Paulistas que formaram as legendarias
bandeiras e que percorreram o Brasil Occidental no começo do
seculo XVIII.</p>

<p>Em 1719 Paschoal Moreira Cabral subindo o Rio Coxipó
Mirim, fundou á margem esquerda d’esta corrente uma povoação
que denominou Forquilha, hoje a cidade de Cuyabá, onde
naquelles tempos se descobriu uma rica mina de ouro.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Em outros tempos, conforme Elysée Reclus, a vastissima
região de Matto-Grosso era apenas, salvo uma estreita zona
mediana, não mais que uma immensa solidão de limites indecisos
e senão desconhecidos pelo menos ainda entregues aos indios e
ás feras, a qual se ligava ao resto do Brasil por simples picadas
de caçadores e pelos cursos dos rios que ali nascem. Realmente
em outros tempos eram tamanhas as difficuldades de communicação
do resto do paiz com Matto-Grosso, que ainda está na
memoria de muitos e no conhecimento dos que leem as paginas
da Historia do Brasil, a impossibilidade que tiveram as tropas
reunidas nas provincias do littoral para irem soccorrer directamente
seus compatriotas de Matto-Grosso, quando a nação
brazileira teve de responder á declaração de guerra do Paraguay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>Com os mil estorvos da travessia, o corpo de exercito composto
de 3000 homens que partiu em Abril de 1865 do Rio de Janeiro
e que só poude organisarse em Uberaba, na bacia superior
do Paraná, estava reduzido apenas a 700 homens quando chegou
a ponto inatacavel e seguro.</p>

<p>Vencida, porem, a guerra com o Paraguay, não ha nenhuma
duvida que a victoria do Brasil escancarou-lhe as portas de
Matto-Grosso, pois que o declive natural do solo e o curso das
aguas com a liberdade da navegação fluvial, garantida pelo triumpho,
estabeleceu um serviço regular de paquetes do Rio de
Janeiro a Corumbá e Cuyabá, pela via do Rio da Prata, passando
por Montevideo, Buenos Ayres e Assumpção.</p>

<p>O caminho fluvial do Guaporé, Madeira e Amazonas foi muito
utilisado no seculo XVIII, depois da exploração feita por Manoel
de Lima em 1742. A navegação pelo Rio Guaporé até o Rio
Madeira, até enfim Sto. Antonio, que é o ponto inicial da navegação
d’este ultimo rio, é longa e cheia de fadiga.</p>

<p>Comtudo Matto-Grosso vae gradualmente se approximando
do litoral do Brasil por meio de estradas de ferro, taes como a
Noroeste do Brasil que ligal-o-á dentro em breve ao Rio de
Janeiro e a estrada de ferro já projectada que partindo de S.
Luiz de Caceres irá até a antiga cidade de Matto-Grosso, donde
o rio Guaporé começa a ser navegavel até Guajará-Mirim, ponto
terminal da grande via Madeira-Mamoré Railway.</p>

<p>Dentro de pouco tempo, como se vê, as estradas mixtas serão
una realidade, comprehendendo rios navegaveis por vapores e
os trechos de communicação entre estes rios. O Paranápanema
e o Ivahy, nos Estados do Paraná e S. Paulo continuam para
outro lado do rio Paraná subindo o Ivinhema e o Brilhante, até
as visinhas montanhas de Miranda, na parte meridional de
Matto-Grosso. As magnificas regiões de Matto-Grosso promettem
ser de futuro, e futuro já bem proximo, um grande centro
de povoamento, e conseguintemente um futuro foco de civilisação,
pela provavel fusão dos diversos elementos de immigração
que para alli certamente concorrorem com o correr
dos tempos e a facilidade que forem apresentando cada vez mais
os meios de communicação. Algures se disse, que a colonisação
far-se-ha sem duvida pelo Sul, pelo lado do Paraguay e da
Argentina; mas nos dias que correm, com a presença da Madeira
Mamoré Railway, indubitavelmente a colonisação darse-á
tambem pelo Norte, facilitada a communicação pelo Rio<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
Amazonas, de que é um dos affluentes o Madeira, á margem
direita do qual está Porto Velho, ponto inicial da mesma
Madeira Mamoré Railway. E estes effeitos já se começam a
produzir com a fundação de um novo Municipio e Comarca de
Matto-Grosso, que é o Municipio de Sto. Antonio do rio Madeira,
cortado pela referida via ferrea e a cuja região dedicaremos
adiante um capitulo especial.</p>

<p>Já vae portanto se enchendo de população a extremidade da
vertente septentrional do territorio de Matto-Grosso, postoque
a da vertente meridional é realmente a que contem maior numero
de habitantes.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Matto-Grosso é uma das regiões de menor relevo do continente
da America do Sul; alli não se encontram elevações de
terreno que constituam verdadeiras montanhas.</p>

<p>As terras elevadas do Brasil tem os seus pontos de culminancia
nas cadeias orientaes da Mantiqueira, dos Aymorés e de
Espinhaço e vão-se abaixando proporcionalmente d’este lado
para o Oeste do Estado de Goyaz e do outro lado são as elevadas
massas da cadeia dos Andes que se inclinam para Leste com os
seus contrafortes. Diz Elysée Reclus, que separando os dois
systemas orographicos, vae serpeando em forma de valle uma
planicie intermediaria, que certamente foi outr’ora um estreito
maritimo separando as duas ilhas—Brasil Oriental e Andes.</p>

<p>Hoje correm aguas fluviaes na depressão por onde passaram
outr’ora as aguas marinhas e a planicie está cheia actualmente de
suas alluviôes. O verdadeiro centro da America do Sul está entre
as duas cidades de Cuyabá e Corumbá.</p>

<p>Pará os que desconhecem a região, as vertentes são as vezes
confundidas com as serras, e em cartas geographicas se desenha
uma cadeia de montanhas mais ou menos continua, entre as
bacias do Tapajóz e do Madeira, entre as nascentes do mesmo
Tapajóz e do Paraguay em seguida, e finalmente entre ainda o Tapajóz
e o Araguaya. Comtudo este relevo semicircular não existe
senão fragmentado, pois que as elevações que dominam as planicies
do alto Paraguay e seus affluentes são na realidade um alto <b>chapadao</b>
de extractos horisontaes ou mui ligeiramente inclinados e carcomidos
pelos rios que descem para o grande Amazonas.</p>

<p>São antes <b>taboleiros</b> que montanhas, ou ao menos estas não se
elevam senão em alguns pontos do grande planalto, attingindo,
aqui e alem, uns mil metros de altura, emquanto a elevação media
do proprio paredão é de quinhentos metros.</p>

<p>Assim, o conjuncto orographico do Estado de Matto-Grosso
chamado indifferentemente cordilheira dos Parecys, não apresenta
aspecto montanhoso senão para o lado do Sul; n’esta face escarpada,
a rocha é talhada a pique ou recortada em agulhas, mas do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
outro lado para o Tapajóz e Xingú, uma encosta longa se estende
e vae morrer gradualmente nas planicies do Estado do Amazonas.</p>

<p>D’Orbigny reconheceu na eminencia da parte septentrional do
Estado de Matto-Grosso a existencia de camadas pertencentes á
edade carbonifera e correspondendo ás rochas da mesma natureza,
que do lado opposto da região se apresenta nos contrafortes
bolivianos de Santa Cruz de la Sierra. Depois d’este, Hart e
Derby verificaram que as partes meridionaes do Araxá, que são
as bordas elevadas do planalto, datam provavelmente das epochas
paleozoicas, e que alli estão representadas as camadas carboniferas
devonianas e siluricas. Leitos fossiliferos encontrados pelo
geologo Smith abaixo das collinas da Chapada, 50 kilometros á
Leste de Cuyabá, puzeram fora de duvida estes factos. Mais ao
Norte, na zona de rochedos que em travessões cortam o Madeira,
o Tapajóz, o Xingú, o Tocantins e seus affluentes, as paredes
desnudadas pela erosão são todas de formação crystallina: granitos,
gneis, porphiros e quartzitos.</p>

<p>As elevações que se desenvolvem na direcção do Sul entre
as nascentes do Paraguay e as do Araguaya, em seguida entre o
Paraguay e o Paraná, não apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas dos
planaltos do Norte. As eminencias da parte Oriental do Estado de
Matto-Grosso foram esbarancadas dos dois lados a Leste e Oeste e
devastadas por estas excavações lateraes, tomam em certos pontos
o aspecto de verdadeiras cadeias de montanhas, e assim é que
desenham-se do Norte ao Sul as serras de S. Jeronymo, do Maracajú
e Anhanbahy.</p>

<p>Rochas eruptivas, chamadas no paiz <b>bassaltos</b>, provavelmente
porphyricas, romperam as camadas de grez que compõem as montanhas
e parece que formaram pela sua desaggregação “terras
roxas,” analogas ás que dão aos fazendeiros de S. Paulo tão
copiosas colheitas de café.</p>

<p>Na especie de circo limitado pelo semi-circulo das elevações
levantam se massiços isolados, rochas, cujos extractos, visiveis
de longe, têm uma regularidade perfeita. Os proprios morros
têm pela maior parte formas geometricas: dir-se-ia que se
esboroaram vastos lanços, deixando paredões lisos, eguaes aos
flancos de uma pyramide. Os cumes horizontaes como se as
pontas tivessem sido decepadas por um instrumento cortante
correspondem a outros cumes, e vê se que outr’ora faziam parte
de um mesmo <b>chapadao</b>. Segundo Taunay, que percorreu o paiz,
estes massiços de grez, de camadas horizontaes e regularmente
superpostas, são formados de sedimentos lacustres coados pelo
mar de agua doce que outr’ora cobriu a região.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span></p>

<p>As ruinas d’estes paredões e das escarpas contribuiram tambem
para mudar a phisionomia da paysagem. Os escombros,
apanhados e arrastados pelos rios, foram revestir de camadas
novas o solo, e muitas saliencias de pedras desappareceram debaixo
dos restos esmigalhados das montanhas e outras não
mostram senão as pontas por cima doz terrenos de formação mais
recente. Massiços que se prendiam aos planaltos e ás cadeias do
interior estão agora separados d’ellas, porque suas bases se acham
soterradas e elles emergem abruptamente do solo. Estes picos
distinctos aos quaes se deu o nome de <b>itambés</b>, erigem seus cabeços
por cima dum mar de arvores comparaveis a gigantescos
edificios erguidos pela mão do homem. A Leste da parte meridional
de Matto-Grosso, elles enfileiramse e agrupam-se em archipelagos,
depois cada vez mais altos e menos numerosos, á proporção
que se caminha para Oeste, ou completamente solitarios
no circulo do horizonte, apparecem até nas margens do rio Paraguay
e ainda do outro lado do mesmo.</p>

<p>O alto Guaporé, Itenez dos Bolivianos, posto que comprehendido
na bacia do immenso Amazonas, como affluente do
Madeira pelo Mamoré, pertence especialmente ao Estado de
Matto-Grosso, pois que a cidade d’este nome foi fundada nas suas
margens e quasi toda a população de Estado se accumulou na
depressão, cuja metade occidental este rio percorre. Sua principal
nascente, muito ferruginosa, desponta n’uma grota junto á borda
do Araxá, e corre primeiro na direcção do Sul, parallellamente a
outros rios que descem para o Paraguay; mas ao deixar as ultimas
collinas o ribeirão curva-se para Oeste, depois para Noroeste
e já engrossado por numerosos affluentes atravessa a planicie,
em que está a cidade que se chamou na sua fundação Villa-Bella
e hoje se denomina Matto-Grosso.</p>

<p>O Paraguay é um dos rios mais notaveis da Terra como via
de navegação, segundo affirma Elysée Reclus; poucos têm um
declive mais suave e fraco proporcionalmente a sua extensão.
Affirma Castelnau que elle nasce na altitude de 305 metros; nos
lugares onde as aguas tranquillas deslizam lentamente para o mar,
a altitude dos campos é apenas de 200 metros, e a partir de um
ponto situado a quatro mil kilometros do mar, o declive é apenas
de cinco centimetros. D’este modo, vapores de pequeno calado
podem subir livremente até os confins do Brasil, muito ao Norte
das duas Republicas da Argentina e Paraguay e chegar á base do
planalto pelo rio principal e pelos seus affluentes, Jaurú, Sepotuba,
Cuyabá, S. Lourenço e Taquary. O Paraguay apresenta
ainda um phenomeno notavel, que é o do cruzamento de suas
nascentes com as dos affluentes do Rio Amazonas.</p>

<p>O Jaurú approxima-se tanto do Guaporé, que seria facil passar
por um canal as aguas do rio Occidental para um affluente do
Jaurú. Outro tributario do Paraguay, o Aguapehy, só está separado
do rio Alegre, que desce para a antiga cidade de Villa-Bella,
hoje Matto-Grosso, por um isthmo de pouca largura, de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
fraco relevo, que segundo Leverger, mede 2400 braças ou 5280
metros. No anno de 1772, e depois, tentou-se cavar um canal em
pontos diversos do isthmo, masas obras não chegaram a termo por
falta de commercio na localidade. Certamente estradas de ferro,
em mais ou menos dias, supprirão a ausencia do canal que ligaria
Montevideo ao Pará, passando em grande parte do Estado de
Matto-Grosso, e por uma via continental navegavel de 8300 kilometros,
segundo refere Bartholomeu Bossi.</p>

<p>O rio Paraguay tern como affluentez principaes os rios S.
Lourenço, engrossado pelas aguas do Cuyabá, o Taquary, o Mondego
e o Apá, limite este ultimo entre o Brasil e a Republica do
Paraguay.</p>

<p>Por occasião das enchentes, seu nivel e o dos seus affluentes
eleva-se de dez e onze metros e derrama-se á esquerda e á direita,
formando um mar ephemero que se estende ao longe, a perder de
vista e se prolonga em <b>banhados</b>. Os primeiros viajantes hespanhoes
deram o nome de lago Xarayes á baixada onde se esparramam
as aguas quasi dormentes dos braços principaes do rio.
Este lago tern de extensão cerca de 600 kilometros de Sul a
Norte, entre as boccas do Jaurú e as collinas do Fecho-dos-Morros
e em certos pontos chega a 250 de largura.</p>

<p>Elle não é permanente, como se pensava outr’ora, mas em
qualquer epocha do anno ha trechos alagados que os indios denominam
bahias e com razão, pois que são bahias de um antigo mar,
que hoje está meio secco, e a maior parte de taes lagoas está em
communicação constante com o rio Paraguay, ora por furos
lateraes, ora por longos canaes, taes como os denominados lagos
de Uberaba, Gaiaba, Mandioré, Caceres, etc. D’entre estes lagos,
uns não contem senão agua doce trazida pela innundação fluvial,
emquanto outros, que são antigas cavidades outr’ora occupadas
por agua do mar, conservam no fundo de seus leitos camadas
salinas, que dão ao liquido um sabor caracteristico. É singular
que este contraste da natureza das aguas doces ou salinas tambem
se produza nos terrenos da vasta planicie, e assim é que campos
extensos, cobertos de ricas alluviôes, deram nascimento a mattas
cerradas, e o agricultor pode muito bem alli obter colheitas
maravilhosas. É certamente por este motivo que os campos de
Matto-Grosso tanto se prestam á industria pastoril.</p>

<p>A horizontalidade do terreno, formada pelo centro da depressão
do immenso valle, impede que o confluente se conserve em
um leito regular, e as aguas escapando por ambos os lados ramificam-se
n’um labirintho do rios e falsos rios. Os ramos lateraes
seguem por entre as zonas dos <b>banhados</b>, até á confluencia do rio
Taquary e do rio Miranda, que descem das montanhas de Leste,
recebendo o primeiro d’estes, na região superior, um affluente, o
Coxim, considerado pelos viajantes como um dos mais pittorescos
rios do Brasil. É curioso ver em alguns lugares o Coxim
estreitara-se entre paredões a pique, de 50 metros de altura, e as
pequenas embarcações correrem sobre elle como no fundo de um
vallão que não tem mais de 10 ou 12 metros de largura.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>O clima de Matto-Grosso é relativamente quente nas regiões
baixas e alagadas pelas enchentes dos rios, taes como Paraguay;
nas regiões dos planaltos o clima é salubre e frio. O movimento
das columnas de ar é determinada pela forma de corredor aberto
entre a cordilheira dos Andes e as terras altas do Brasil, bem no
centro do continente Sul Americano, e por elle são arrastadas;
aos ventos tepidos proveniente da região da Amazonia, succedem
no inverno ventos que sopram do frio pampa. Nas alturas do
circo de chapadões e montanhas que rodeiam a planicie do Estado
de Matto-Grosso, o frio desce abaixo do ponto de congelação. As
copiosas chuvas trazidas pelo rebojo dos ventos que contornam o
planalto central do Brasil e vem esbarrar nos primeiros contrafortes
dos Andes, cahem com muita regularidade no verão e são
frequentemente acompanhadas de trovoadas.</p>

<p>Consoante alguns observadores, a queda da agua annual é de
3 metros, e em Cuyabá contam-se mais ou menos 135 dias de
chuva por anno medio.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>O Estado de Matto-Grosso, pela sua situação geographica no
continente Sul Americano, collocado no ponto de separação das
duas grandes bacias do Brasil, reune ao mesmo tempo as floras
e as faunas da região da Amazonia e das regiões Platinas. Entretanto,
a flora tropical predomina com sua infinita variedade
de formas vegetaes em todas as regiões das florestas, isto é, á
beira dos rios, e entre as especies famosas habitantes das margens
do Rio Mar, poucas ha que não estejam representadas na região
do alto Guaporé, ou das quaes se não encontrem congeneres.</p>

<p>Em nenhuma parte se desenvolve como alli as palmeiras Cipós,
e em 1875 uma commissão de limites descobriu uma d’estas palmeiras
<b>Urumbamba (Calamus procumbeus) ou Desmoncus
rudentum</b> de Martius, com mais de 200 metros de comprimento e
apenas com a grossura de um centimetro! O algodoeiro o tabacco,
a ipeccacuanha, chamada alli <b>poaya</b> nascem espontaneamente nas
planicies e nas florestas; esta ultima sobretudo colhem-na nas
florestas do alto Jaurú e dos rios visinhos. O mate, a mais notavel
das plantas da zona meridional e que faz a riqueza de algumas
regiões como do Estado do Paraná, cresce alli espontaneamente
entre Miranda e o rio Apá, sem fallar propriamente da seringueira,
que é encontrada em immensas e cerradas florestas n’uma extensão
comprehendida desde Cuyabá até o Madeira, e a qual fará
o assumpto especial d’este ligeiro exposto.</p>

<p>As madeiras de construcção são abundantissimas e em grande
variedade, podendo-se citar o pao-brasil, o jacarandá, a peroba, a
canella, o cedro, o jequitibá, a massaranduba, o pao-d’arco, o pao-ferro,
o pao-setim, o vinhatico, etc.</p>

<p>Entre os animaes, encontram-se os veados, as antas e as onças,
alem de um grande numero de outros pequenos, proprios das regiões
tropicaes. As aves e os passaros, aves ribeirinhas e passaros
cantores das florestas, são pela sua variedade quasi innumeros. A
avestruz vinda das regiões dos pampas chegou as planicies marginaes
do alto Paraguay; os peixes abundam n’uma riquissima e
magnifica variedade nos grandes e pequenos rios.</p>

<p>No reino mineral, o Estado de Matto-Grosso possúe minas
numerosas de ouro, prata, platina, cobre, estanho, chumbo, mercurio,
carvão de pedra, ferro, pedras, preciosas, diamantes, &amp;c.,
existindo já quatro companhias inglezas na exploração de minas
de ouro. Ha tambem granitos, crystal de rocha, malacacheta,
pedra calcaria, sal-gemma, &amp;c. Finalmente nas regiões do Araxá,
ha fontes de aguas mineraes sulphurosas.</p>

<p>O Estado de Matto-Grosso é a região do Brasil onde se encontram
as maiores fazendas de gado, não só em extensão territorial,
como em numero de cabeças de gado vaccum e cavallar, havendo
algumas que contam cem mil cabeças. Calcula-se o numero de
cabeças de gado vaccum em Matto-Grosso em dois bilhões e
quinhentas mil.</p>

<p>Nos dias que correm, ainda é um pouco difficil o transporte de
gado de Matto-Grosso para o Rio de Janeiro, principalmente, e a
exportação é feita pelo caminho de Oeste até Uberaba, onde a
invernada se faz em dois ou trez mezes, até que os animaes se
refaçam e possam ser conduzidos em caminho de ferro até o
littoral do Rio de Janeiro. Vê-se, entretanto que, com a terminação
da via ferrea Noroeste do Brasil, o problema do transporte para o
littoral será resolvido, assim como a Madeira Mamoré Railway,
contando Matto-Grosso presentemente com rios navegaveis e dentro
de bem pouco tempo com a via ferrea de que já fallamos, de S. Luiz
de Caceres á antiga cidade de Matto-Grosso, donde começa a
ser navegavel o rio Guaporé até Guajará-Mirim, ponto terminal
da Madeira Mamoré Railway, resolverá tambem o problema da
exportação de gado para os Estados do Amazonas, Pará, &amp;c.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>D’este leve exposto conclue-se que o territorio do Estado de
Matto-Grosso é grandemente rico de gado e ouro, de diamante e
café, de tabaco e mate, de borracha e ipecacuanha e de todos os
productos dos tropicos e das zonas temperadas:—elle só bastaria
para constituir um dos mais vastos e mais opulentos imperios do
mundo!</p>

<p>Dotado de um clima, se bem que quente ao Norte, porem
temperado e mesmo frio nas demais regiões, como a dos planaltos,
apresentando um accumulo de riquezas raro e ainda pouco explorado
como está, forçosamente para lá o homem das diversas
partes da Terra, na sua constante actividade, na sua crescente lucta
pela vida, immigrará e concorrerá com a intelligencia e com o
esforço do trabalho, para fazer d’aquella parte do Brasil um grande
emporio de industrias, commercio, navegação, caminhos de ferro e
conseguintemente uma grande nascente de civilisação, donde, pela
fusão das diversas raças, o mesmo homem surgirá sempre grande,
sempre vencedor no immenso concerto e na elevada harmonia da

<p>A borracha que se vê n’esta Exposição é extrahida e vinda toda
das vastas regiões cortadas pelos rios Machados, ou Dgy-Paraná,
Jamary, Jacy-Paraná, Mutum-Paraná, Paca-Nova e Guaporé com
seus affluentes, aquelles a seu turno affluentes do grande rio
Madeira, em cuja margem direita está situado o novo Municipio
e Comarca de Sto. Antonio do rio Madeira, installado em 2 de
Julho do anno corrente.</p>

<p>O novo Municipio tem os seguintes limites: partindo da
cachoeira de Sto. Antonio no rio Madeira, no parallelo de 8° 48′,
o rio Madeira acima; o rio Mamoré acima até a foz do Guaporé
no parallelo de 12, este parallelo até a sua intersecção com o rio
Camararé; este rio abaixo até a sua confluencia no Juruema; este
rio abaixo até o ponto em que se reune ao Arinos; o parallelo que
n’este ponto passa até a sua intersecção com o rio S. Manuel; este
rio abaixo até sua confluencia no Tapajóz; e d’este ponto até encontrar
a cachoeira de Sto. Antonio no Rio Madeira a linha que
extrema os territorios dos Estados de Matto-Grosso e do Amazonas.</p>

<p>Todo o immenso territorio do novo Municipio é cortado ao
Norte pela Madeira Mamoré Railway, que conta 365 kilometros
de via ferrea já construidos, partindo de Porto Velho no Estado
do Amazonas, distante 7 kilometros da sede propriamente do
Municipio, até Guajará-Mirim.</p>

<p>A via ferrea Madeira Mamoré, alem das estações já construidas,
em Porto Velho, Candelaria, Sto. Antonio, Jacy-Paraná, Abunã,
Villa Murtinho e Guajará-Mirim, tem 46 pontos de parada que
correspondem ao numero dos seus acampamentos.</p>

<p>Entre as vias de communicação do novo Municipio de Sto.
Antonio do rio Madeira com os visinhos Estados do Amazonas e
Pará e tambem com a capital e outras cidades do Estado de Matto-Grosso,
comecemos por dizer algo da linha telegraphica ora ainda
em construcção por conta do Governo Federal e da respectiva
estrada de rodagem. São duas as turmas de engenheiros e
operarios que constroem a linha telegraphica, uma partida do
Norte—Sto. Antonio—e outra do Sul—Diamantina. Partindo de
Sto. Antonio, a linha telegraphica segue o parallelo 8° 48′ até encontrar
o rio Jamary, n’uma extensão de cerca de sessenta kilometros;
ahi chegando desvia se para o rumo das cabeceiras do rio
Dgy-Paraná, no lugar denominado Urupá, onde se deve encontrar
com a turma do Sul e onde a ligação será feita. A 3 de Junho de
1912 na mais alta cabeceira do rio Dgy-Paraná, já foi inaugurada a
estação telegraphica de José Bonifacio, pela turma do Sul, emquanto
a do Norte tambem já inaugurou em data anterior as estações de
Sto. Antonio do rio Madeira e Jamary. Este emprehendimento
notavel está sob a intelligencia e extraordinaria dedicação do snr.
Coronel de Engenheiros do Exercito Brazileiro, Candido Rondon,
que tem o record das construcções de linhas telegraphicas no Brasil
e quiçá na America do Sul.</p>

<p>Prompta dentro de um anno, mais ou menos, a linha telegraphica
marginará uma estrada de rodagem de 40 metros de largura, de
cerca de duzentas leguas de extensão a partir de Cuyabá até Sto.
Antonio do rio Madeira. Esta immensa via de communicação
cortando todo um vasto sertão sobretudo rico em borracha e ouro,
terá de dez em dez leguas uma estação telegraphica.</p>

<p>Em Porto Velho, ponto inicial da Madeira Mamoré Railway,
ha já por sua vez funccionando uma poderosa estação radiographica
do systema Marconi e que se communica diariamente com Manáos
e já se tem communicado mesmo com Iquitos e com os Departamentos
Federaes do Acre, do Purús e do Juruá.</p>

<p>Quanto á navegação de Manáos até Sto. Antonio do rio
Madeira, ella é feita em boas condições e em navios confortaveis.
Nas aguas baixas, isto é, nos tempos da secca do grande rio Amazonas
e seus affluentes, sobem de Manáos até aquelles pontos os
navios de tonelagem até 500, nos tempos de aguas altas, em que
o valle do Amazonas todo se alaga, navios transantlaticos de 7
mil a nove mil toneladas sobem de Manáos até alli, em quatro dias
de viagem, como já tem succedido no transporte de materiaes para
construcção da Madeira Mamoré Railway, acostando facilmente
em 2 caes feitos de madeira de lei, o primeiro construido em frente
as officinas de Porto Velho e o segundo em Candelaria. Por sua
vez o Governo da Republica está resolvido a construir um caes
de pedra e cal entre Porto Velho e Sto. Antonio.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span></p>

<p>Os pequenos navios que navegam durante a secca dos rios, teem
accomodações para passageiros de 1.ª e 3.ª classe, são illuminados
á luz electrica, possuem fabricas de gelo e fazem bem a viagem de
Manáos a Porto Velho e Sto. Antonio em cerca de 5 dias, com uma
media de velocidade de 10 milhas por hora, fazendo escala por
pequenos portos e cidades amazonenses, situadas nas margens do
rio Madeira. Na descida tanto dos grandes transantlaticos como
dos pequenos navios de 500 toneladas, a viagem se faz mais rapidamente,
em 3 e 4 dias.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>A borracha de Sto. Antonio do rio Madeira é da mesma
natureza phisica e chimica de toda borracha do valle do Amazonas,
e esta asserção salta á vista, quando nos lembramos que a parte
do Estado de Matto-Grosso occupada pelo novo Municipio é
justamente aquella limitrophe dos Estados do Amazonas e do Pará.</p>

<p>Na parça de Manáos, para onde vem o producto pela via do rio
Madeira, e na de Belém do Pará onde é enviada pela via do rio
Tapajóz, ella é sempre cotada pelos mesmos preços e nas mesmas
condições das produzidas propriamente nas regiões da Amazonia.</p>

<p>A sua producção, que vem num crescendo desde o anno de 1906,
é actualmente de cerca de 2 milhões de kilos annuaes, que augmentará
certamente numa proporção—impossivel desde já de ser prevista—com
a presença e o desenvolvimento da Madeira Mamoré Railway,
da estrada de rodagem da linha telegraphica e os progressos constantes
da navegação.</p>

<p>No. 1ro. semestre do anno fluente a producção da borracha foi
superior a de não importa qual seja o anno desde 1907, conforme
se verifica do quadro estatistico annexo.</p>

<p>N’aquellas regiões, comprehendidas desde Cuyabá até a sede
do novo Municipio, existem seringaes capazes de produzir por si
sós dentro do periodo de um anno, mais de quarenta milhões de
kilos de borracha.</p>

<p>Pará attingir a este ideal, bastaria que os capitaes concorressem
para exploração de uma industria extractiva, cuja fonte brota espontaneamente
da terra sem carencia de cultivo e para animar e
estimular aquelles que desejam ali empregar os seus esforços e
capitaes, ahi está a lei do Governo do Estado de Matto-Grosso, que
offerece favores especiaes aos que, alem propriamente da exploração
dos vastos seringaes já existentes, se quizerem dedicar ao plantio e
cultivo da mesma <b>syphonia</b> elastica.</p>

<p>Tratando-se uma exposição de borracha em New-York, é
justo chamarmos a attenção dos que nos queiram ler para o facto
bem importante da concorrencia que já começa dos capitaes norte-americanos
para a exploração d’aquella região.</p>

<p>O grande capitalists Percival Farquhar, americano do Norte, já
incorporou duas companhias sob as razões sociaes de Julio Muller
Rubber, e Guaporé Rubber, com o fim não só de explorar a industria
extractiva de <b>hevea brasiliensis</b>, como tambem para os diversos
ramos de agricultura attinentes ao fabrico do assucar, dos tecidos
de algodão &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span></p>

<p>Actualmente a extracção da borracha nos vastos seringaes do
Municipio de Sto. Antonio do rio Madeira occupa cerca de cinco
mil trabalhadores, mas este numero augmentará cada vez mais,
positivamente, á proporção que o referido Municipio se for tornando
o ponto de convergencia para onde affluirão as correntes commerciaes,
industriaes e agricolas dos centros de Matto-Grosso e da
Republica da Bolivia.</p>

<p>Isto é facil de imaginar, quando vemos que a estrada de ferro
Madeira Mamoré por seá em communicação para o Sul com S. Luiz
de Caceres por meio do rio Guaporé e da estrada de ferro que de S.
Luiz de Caceres irá até á antiga cidade de Matto-Grosso, ligando
assim a bacia do Prata de intermedio o rio Paraguay—á bacia do rio
Amazonas, e para Leste, a mesma Madeira Mamoré Railway levará
os seus trilhos até Ribeira-Alta, ligando as vastas e riquissimas
regiões da Republica Boliviana tambem á bacia do Amazonas, de
intermedio o rio Madeira. Presentemente, parte para aquella região
o Engenheiro chefe e Director da Madeira Mamoré Railway, Mr. H.
Dose, que vai dar começo a construcção do referido ramal de Guajará
Mirim—Matto-Grosso—á Ribeira Alta-Bolivia—, que ficará concluida
dentro do praso de um anno e meio e terá cerca de cem kilometros
de extensão.</p>

<p>Accrescendo a isto ainda a construcção prompta, dentro de um
anno, da grande estrada de rodagem da linha telegraphica de
Cuyabá até Sto. Antonio do rio Madeira, poderemos facilmente
imaginar o que n’um futuro, que nada faz pensar será muito remoto,
irá ser o novo Municipio de Sto. Antonio do rio Madeira, como um
verdadeiro e incontestavel ponto de convergencia de tão fortes e
ricas correntes de desenvolvimento de progresso e de civilisação.</p>

<p>Antes de terminar, não devemos esquecer que o territorio
em questão não se presta somente á producção da gomma
elastica, que aliás como em todo o valle do Amazonas é agreste e
nasce á lei da natureza. Convem dizer que alli, alem do cacao e do
algodão, que tambem são agrestes, podem ser plantados e cultivados
a canna de assucar, o café, a baunilha, o milho, o feijão, o arroz, o
tabaco, a batata, a castanha, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A propria Madeira Mamoré Railway Co., concessionaria de
uma vasta faixa de terra á margem de sua linha ferrea, pensa em
fazer o plantio do cacao, da canna de assucar, &amp;c., &amp;c., aproveitando
os referidos terrenos.</p>

<p>De tudo o que fica exposto em linhas bem ligeiras e nas quaes
procuramos nos approximar sempre da verdade, dando noticias
sobre a região em questão, pode-se concluir facilmente que só o
novo Municipio de Sto. Antonio do rio Madeira, que exporta
actualmente para o commercio mundial, via Pará e Manáos, cerca
de 2 milhões de kilos de borracha, passará a exportar dentro de
poucos annos, sobretudo com a immigração que todos os factores
nos levam esperar, de 10 a 15 milhões.</p>
